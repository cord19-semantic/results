<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">These first UK cases of COVID-19 raise important points about the management of cases of HCID in England. The decision to test for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a clinical and epidemiological case definition, and testing is only approved if this is met. When tested, neither of these people clearly met the current case definition, and had criteria been strictly applied, testing might not have been done. A decision to test was made because of high clinical suspicion and in response to latest available information about the distribution of infection. It is important that testing is appropriately targeted, and this is best done by applying clear case definitions. However, with any newly emerging infection, case definitions must evolve rapidly as information accrues. There should also be room for flexibility on the basis of discussion with clinical and public health experts</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">As of March 5, 2020, there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan.1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. The health systems in these locations have generally been able to adapt,2 , 3 but their resilience could be affected if the COVID-19 epidemic continues for many more months and increasing numbers of people require services. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was increased in all three locations, although expansion of the diagnostic capacity to university and large private laboratories in Japan is still ongoing. In Hong Kong, initially, only pneumonia patients without a microbiological diagnosis were tested, but surveillance has been broadened to include all inpatients with pneumonia and a purposively sampled proportion of outpatients and emergency attendees totalling about 1500 per day (Leung GM, unpublished). Japan's testing strategy has also evolved with diagnostic tests now offered to all suspected cases irrespective of their travel history; however, there are reports of cases that should have been tested but were not.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">As of 15 February 2020, Singapore had screened a total of 991 suspect cases for COVID-19, of which 72 cases tested positive, 812 cases tested negative, while the remaining 107 had pending results.(1) Besides optimising sample type to increase yield, (2) the challenge in clinical management of suspect cases lies in deciding whether they may be de-isolated or if further isolation and repeat testing is required. No single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspect case. In our series of positive cases, samples from one suspect case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts,(3) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may not return positive initially. (4) Our suspect case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection. Dual infections can occur in 10- 20% of viral acute respiratory infections, as has been reported with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. (5) In our case series, one patient with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal aspirate also exhibited clinical symptoms compatible with dengue fever. This was laboratory confirmed by dengue NS1 antigen test. (PL Lim, personal communication).</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Speed is critical in the response to COVID-19. So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely? The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases—and test them faster—have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests. In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China in December 2019. The first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63) are a cause of the common cold.1, 2 However, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease: the SARS coronavirus in 2002–2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012.1, 2 Chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen.3 An Australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of China), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. Information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. We know that SARS‐CoV‐2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. The cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease.4, 5 Early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in China suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 is as transmissible as SARS coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses.6, 7 The timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. While reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known.8 Careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days.9 Reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of “superspreading” events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks.10 The importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41% of cases in Wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients).4 As at 26 February 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in Australia, across five jurisdictions. Although reported case numbers in China are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in Japan, and in South Korea, Iran and Italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. However, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. Although absolute case numbers are small in Australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non‐Australians coming from China, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our Asian community (https://insig​htplus.mja.com.au/2020/5/coron​avirus-no-place-for-racism-xenop​hobia/).</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Taiwan is 81 miles off the coast of mainland China and was expected to have the second highest number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its proximity to and number of flights between China.1 The country has 23 million citizens of which 850 000 reside in and 404 000 work in China.2,3 In 2019, 2.71 million visitors from the mainland traveled to Taiwan.4 As such, Taiwan has been on constant alert and ready to act on epidemics arising from China ever since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. Given the continual spread of COVID-19 around the world, understanding the action items that were implemented quickly in Taiwan and assessing the effectiveness of these actions in preventing a large-scale epidemic may be instructive for other countries. COVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Chinese and Taiwanese were expected to travel for the holidays. Taiwan quickly mobilized and instituted specific approaches for case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect the public health. Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers’ infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days. Persons with low risk (no travel to level 3 alert areas) were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS (short message service) messaging to their phones for faster immigration clearance; those with higher risk (recent travel to level 3 alert areas) were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phone to ensure that they remained at home during the incubation period. Moreover, Taiwan enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms (based on information from the National Health Insurance [NHI] database) who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19; 1 was found of 113 cases. The toll-free number 1922 served as a hotline for citizens to report suspicious symptoms or cases in themselves or others; as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine. This rapid response included hundreds of action items (eTable in the Supplement).</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities.</p>

(Some also simply ban or quarantine those who have recently been in outbreak hot spots.) Exit and entry screening may look reassuring, but experience with other diseases shows it’s exceedingly rare for screeners to detect infected passengers. Just last week, eight passengers who later tested positive for COVID-19 arrived in Shanghai from Italy and passed the airport screeners unnoticed, for example.

Limited clinical experience in managing pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates has been reported from China recently based on a case series of nine pregnancies with confirmed COVID-19 treated in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and 10 neonates (nine pregnancies) delivered at five different hospitals,11, 12 although many more cases (>100) of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have been treated and delivered in several hospitals in China according to the news releases and media reports. So far, no maternal deaths have been reported. There appears to be some risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, fetal tachycardia and fetal distress when the infection occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, there is no evidence suggesting transplacental transmission based on very limited data, as the analysis of amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breast milk samples available from six of the nine patients were found to be negative for SARS-COV-2.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-14</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% -  67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.</jats:p></p>

Here we document the response of the Emergency Medical System (EMS) of the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, to the COVID-19 outbreak.On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.2 Since then, the Italian Government has implemented extraordinary measures to restrict viral spread, including interruptions of air traffic from China, organised repatriation flights and quarantines for Italian travellers in China, and strict controls at international airports' arrival terminals. Local medical authorities adopted specific WHO recommendations to identify and isolate suspected cases of COVID-19.Such recommendations were addressed to patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and who had travelled to an endemic area in the previous 14 days or who had worked in the health-care sector, having been in close contact with patients with severe respiratory disease with unknown aetiology. Suspected cases were transferred to preselected hospital facilities where the SARS-CoV-2 test was available and infectious disease units were ready for isolation of confirmed cases.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Policies and public health efforts have not addressed the gendered impacts of disease outbreaks.1 The response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears no different. We are not aware of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases. Recognising the extent to which disease outbreaks affect women and men differently is a fundamental step to understanding the primary and secondary effects of a health emergency on different individuals and communities, and for creating effective, equitable policies and interventions. Although sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men and women so far, there seem to be sex differences in mortality and vulnerability to the disease.2 Emerging evidence suggests that more men than women are dying, potentially due to sex-based immunological3 or gendered differences, such as patterns and prevalence of smoking.4 However, current sex-disaggregated data are incomplete, cautioning against early assumptions. Simultaneously, data from the State Council Information Office in China suggest that more than 90% of health-care workers in Hubei province are women, emphasising the gendered nature of the health workforce and the risk that predominantly female health workers incur.</p>

Patients in incubation period and healthy carriers are possible sources for transmission. However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identified due to the symptoms absent. The research evidence is very lacking so far, although there are a few studies suggesting that presymptomatic or asymptomatic carrier may cause COVID-19 transmission. Nearly half of the literature is in the state of preprint without peer review. The question of "the degree to which presymptomatic or asymptomatic infections can transmit" is not fully understood. There is an urgent need to screen infected carriers in larger close contacts or in the general population, and assess their risk for transmission.</p>

The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients have been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public health measures since the lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Strict protection for lung cancer patients is needed to avoid infection. Lung cancer patients are difficult to differentiate from patients with COVID-19 in terms of clinical symptoms, which will bring great trouble to the clinical work and physical and mental health of lung cancer patients. This review will demonstrate how to applicate appropriate and individual management for lung cancer patients to protect them from COVID-19.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-08</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking  RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date.  The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy Due to the physiological changes in their immune and cardiopulmonary systems, pregnant women are more likely to develop severe illness after infection with respiratory viruses. In 2009, pregnant women accounted for 1% of patients infected with influenza A subtype H1N1 virus, but they accounted for 5% of all H1N1-related deaths6. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two notable strains of the coronavirus family, are both known to be responsible for severe complications during pregnancy, including the need for endotracheal intubation, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), renal failure and death7, 8. Interestingly, the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Chen et al.9 reported the clinical characteristics of nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the third trimester, which comprised mainly fever and cough. Other symptoms included myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Data from laboratory tests showed that the majority of patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein, and chest CT scans showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress in two of nine patients and premature rupture of the membranes in two of nine patients. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Another series10 of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting from mid-trimester onwards, or during the postpartum period, reported similar findings except for one woman requiring ICU care and ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome after the infection was diagnosed 2?days postpartum. In general, both studies reported that the clinical characteristics of the pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia2-4. These observations are also in line with what has been learned about COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy in several other hospitals in Wuhan, China. Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk-assessment and infection-control guidelines following exposure to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all healthcare professionals in clinical settings11.</p>

We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir. The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.</jats:p></p>

The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.</p>

With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients from COVID-19.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Introduction: With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks.  Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus.    Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair).   Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.</jats:p></p>

Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak.  Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today recommended a dramatic shift in how it implements regulations that control whether laboratories can use diagnostic kits created in-house to test for infections of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). “We issued a policy this morning that allows us to have a lot of flexibility around the development of diagnostic tests,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn at a White House briefing with President Donald Trump this afternoon. “We expect this policy to have a significant impact.” The change could greatly expand the number of laboratories able to do coronavirus testing. The U.S. government has come under severe criticism for not providing nearly enough tests needed to understand the extent of spread in the population. A test kit produced and distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was shelved after state and local lab trying it out discovered that it contained a faulty reagent. As a result, many labs that have the capability to test themselves have not been allowed to do so. The new recommendations focus on “high-complexity testing laboratories” that are certified under federal rules known as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. This group of facilities includes many hospital labs, like the one that epidemiologist Michael Mina works at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Essentially it’s opening up a clear and concise avenue for labs like the one at Brigham and Women’s,” says Mina. “It’s what I’ve been advocating for a month now.”</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background There’s an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020. Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics. Conclusions Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data. While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% genome sequence similarity to SARS-CoV and 50% genome sequence homology to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—all three coronaviruses are known to cause severe respiratory symptoms. Liver impairment has been reported in up to 60% of patients with SARS3 and has also been reported in patients infected with MERS-CoV.4 At least seven relatively large-scale case studies have reported the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 In this Comment, we assess how the liver is affected using the available case studies and data from The Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital, Beijing, China. These data indicate that 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities and 14–53% cases reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during disease progression (table). Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have higher rates of liver dysfunction. In a study in The Lancet by Huang and colleagues,5 elevation of AST was observed in eight (62%) of 13 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with seven (25%) of 28 patients who did not require care in the ICU. Moreover, in a large cohort including 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces or provincial municipalities, more severe patients with disease had abnormal liver aminotransferase levels than did non-severe patients with disease.1 Furthermore, in another study,8 patients who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by CT scan while in the subclinical phase (ie, before symptom onset) had significantly lower incidence of AST abnormality than did patients diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of COVID-19.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The authors concluded by use of epidemiological statistics that because the proportion of patients with cancer histories was higher in a cohort with COVID-19 than in the population in China, patients with cancer were more likely to develop COVID-19. They found 18 COVID-19 patients with cancer histories among 1590 COVID-19 patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial regions. Of these 16 patients (two of the 18 patients had unknown treatment status), only four had undergone surgery or chemotherapy within the previous month; 12 had recovered from initial cancer treatments (eg, surgery or chemotherapy) and had no obvious immunosuppression. We therefore do not think the COVID-19 infections in the 12 survivors of previous cancers were associated with their cancers. COVID-19 is a highly contagious infection to which everyone, to our knowledge, is susceptible; the most important morbidity factor is exposure to an infection source.2 Furthermore, although the authors indicate that patients with cancer had worse outcomes from COVID-19, they also reported the median age of these patients (63·1 years) to be significantly higher than for those without cancer (48·7 years), suggesting that older age is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes</p>

Methods In the epidemic of COVID-19 from January 21 to February 15, 2020, 128 patients with orthopaedic trauma sought emergency treatment at Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The People&rsquo;s Hospital of Wuhan University. They were 71 males and 57 females with an average age of 48.7 years (from 5 to 88 years).Of them, 107 cases were treated at the outpatient department and 21 hospitalized. Emergency operations were carried out for 4 cases and selective operationsfor 17 cases. COVID-19 infections were recorded in the patients and medical staff as well. Measures taken and experiences learned were summarized since the epidemicoutbreak of COVID-19. Results Of the 107 cases treated at the outpatient department, 3 had a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 and 3 a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 4 cases undergoing emergency surgery, one was suspected of having COVID-19. Of the 17 cases undergoing selective surgery, one was diagnosed definitely as COVID-19and 2 were suspected of COVID-19. Two nurses were diagnosed definitely as having mildCOVID-19.One doctor and one nurse were suspected of COVID-19. Since the COVID-19 infections in medical staff occurred all before the preventive and control measures for COVID-19 had been implemented,is was not ruled out that their infections might have come from communities. Conclusions It is particularly important for medical institutions of all levels to maintain safe and effective routine services while doing well in COVID-19 prevention. In the epidemic of COVID-19, front-line medical staff in emergency traumatic orthopedics is faced with great challenges in the process of diagnosing and treating patients. High-quality and safe medical services can be provided as long as nosocomial COVID-19infection is effectively controlled by rigid screening of patientsnewly admitted, classified management of inpatients, optimal management of inpatient wards, standard preventive measures in perioperative period, a perfect system for medical protection, and medical education for patients and their carers.</p>

The modelling study by Marius Gilbert and colleagues in The Lancet identifies each African country's risk of importation of COVID-19 from China, using data on the volume of air travel from three airports in provinces in China to African countries. Gilbert and colleagues use two indicators to determine the capacity of countries to detect and respond to cases: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Based on their analysis, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa had the highest importation risk, and a moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had moderate risk with variable capacity and high vulnerability. In the model, the risk mainly originates from Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing. The study provides a valuable tool that can help countries in Africa prioritise and allocate resources as they prepare to respond to the potential introduction and spread of COVID-19.</p>

That’s because this week, they began analysing a mountain of nose and throat swabs collected from hospitals in the region. Already, the researchers are seeing clear signs that the virus has infected vastly more people than have been formally detected. Scientists fear coronavirus spread in countries least able to contain it Washington state has become the United States’ ground zero for COVID-19, which has now spread to more than 90 countries worldwide in what seems to be a new and dangerous phase of the outbreak. Washington has declared a state emergency, and ten people there have died from the disease. But the number of confirmed cases in Washington — 70 — is still an underestimate resulting from a lack of testing, researchers agree. A genomic analysis posted online on 29 February suggested that hundreds of people in western Washington might already be infected. Academic scientists have mostly been prevented from measuring the extent of the US outbreak because of federal rules restricting the number of labs qualified to run diagnostic tests. But that is changing now, and helps account for why the state's caseload jumped from 10 to 70 this week. Dozens of virologists and genomicists have now kicked into high gear in Seattle, dropping or adapting projects to devote resources to the outbreak. Researchers are working around the clock to find out how many people have the disease in the area. Others are analysing genomes to reveal how the virus is transmitted or developing new therapies. The scientists are racing to help Washington avoid the fate of Hubei province in China, where more than 2,900 people have died of COVID-19 so far. The coronavirus emerged in the province’s city Wuhan in December, and the initial response from officials was slow. “We are past the point of containment,” says Helen Chu, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Washington School of Medicine (UW Medicine) in Seattle. “So now we need to keep the people who are vulnerable from getting sick.”</p>

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P &lt;0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P &lt;0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature ≥37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients.

They presented with mild respiratory symptoms to their local health facilities at 4 days and 8 days, respectively, after arrival in Vinh Phuc. Both individuals were initially placed into respiratory isolation in hospital. Case 1 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative organism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on Jan 30, 2020, and remained in isolation until recovery. Case 2 was discharged from isolation in hospital after having one negative test result on Jan 28 (11 days after returning from Wuhan). Following discharge, the patient attended a family social function. 2 days later, she was readmitted after a second nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 taken during her time in hospital was reported as positive. Screening of 79 individuals who had been in contact with these two patients (namely, family members in the same household and anyone who had been within 2 m of them) was initiated on Jan 31. Six individuals from the same work team, who had also travelled from Wuhan on Jan 17, were isolated, and four of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3, 4, and 8 in Vinh Phuc, and one case from another province). Five secondary cases were diagnosed within the social network of case 2. These included three household members (cases 6, 7, and 11) and two people who had attended the social function (cases 5 and 9; appendix p 1).

The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Corona Virus Disease- 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Two other corona virus infections-- SARS in 2002–2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-- both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All three of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by beta-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020 and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance</p>

The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation.  Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu. Conclusion: Sources of population follow data and methods impact the estimates of local cases in Wuhan before city lock down.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and close contact. Pulmonary function testing procedures have been associated with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients/subjects and medical staffs. Effective prevention and control strategies must be compulsorily implemented to prevent nosocomial infection. This recommendation is intended to be followed by healthcare workers (HCWs) of pulmonary function testing laboratory when COVID-19 is in epidemic. Based on the features of pulmonary function testing, precaution principles and strategies are developed in three aspects of management for HCWs, operating procedure, environment and equipment. Indications of pulmonary function testing should be followed strictly. It is strongly recommended to suspend the test for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative. Medical personnel should mandatorily adhere to the standard stratification of precaution measures. Patients/Subjects should be isolated in a separate area for testing. Disposable in-line filters must be used during pulmonary function testing. Cleaning and disinfection procedures for environment and equipment in pulmonary function testing laboratory should be paid more attention. 新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）主要通过呼吸道飞沫传播及密切接触传播。肺功能检查可增加医务人员和受检者发生COVID-19传播的风险，必须严 格执行有效的预防和控制措施以防止院内感染。为了指导肺功能检查室医务人员做好防控工作，本指引结合肺功能检查的特点，制订了当前疫情下肺功能检查在医务 人员管理、检查流程管理和检查环境物品管理3个方面的要求及注意事项。主要强调在疫情流行期间，必须严格掌握肺功能检查的适应证，强烈建议COVID-1 9确诊病例或疑似病例在传染期内暂缓检查，其他病患如非病情急需也暂缓检查；肺功能室医务人员应严格执行标准分级防护措施；受试者应在单独区域进行隔离检 查；检查时必须使用一次性呼吸过滤器；并重视肺功能检查环境和设备的清洁消毒。.</p>

Owing to rigorous quarantine and control measures taken in China, routine neonatal health surveillance and follow-up have become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of newborns that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-24</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.</jats:p></p>

This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.</jats:p></p>

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L; age &lt; 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age &lt; 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L, 0%) (P &lt;0.001), respectively.  Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.</jats:p></p>

By early January 2020 the virus was identified and the sequence determined. The virus (termed SARS‐CoV‐2) shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat‐SLCoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4]. From the first cohort of patients, 8 complete genomes were 99.9% identical in sequence. Given that the typical RNA coronavirus evolves at a rate of 104 nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [4]. SARS‐CoV‐2 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands, surfaces and aerosolised droplets; extensive human‐to‐human transmission is evident, with clusters of infected families and medical staff [5]. The number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly, at a rate that far outstripped the rate of rise of cases of SARS in 2002/3, raising serious global health concerns. By the 21st January, COVID‐19 cases were widespread across mainland China, soon spreading beyond the Chinese borders.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, has constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, with cases confirmed in multiple countries. Currently patients are the main source of infection. We report a confirmed case of COVID-19 whose oropharyngeal swab test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned positive in convalescence. This case highlights the importance of dynamic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for infectivity assessment.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-17</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>The total number of COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this infection in Wuhan, China has reached 40000 and are still growing. To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Although the epidemic outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restricted freecoming and going of people, it was inevitable that fracture patients, elderly ones with low-energy fracture in part ICU lar, sought medical attention. In this special situation, itwas crucial for trauma orthopaedists to do well in prevention and control of COVID-19 infection and in perioperative management of their patients as well while they went on with routine diagnosis and treatment. It was also of great significance for prognosis of the patients and prevention and control of the epidemic that orthopaedic surgeons chose proper surgical and anesthesia methods. In the process of diagnosis, treatment, nursing and rehabilitation, medical staff too was challenged by how to prevent themselves from infection and how to eliminate cluster COVID-19 transmission. This paper, from the perspectives of orthopedic surgeons, nurses and patients, expounds briefly on the management of patients with orthopedic trauma during the epidemic period of COVID-19 in a mode of multidisciplinary comprehensive interventions.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">As in previous health crises, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has raised questions about preparedness and emergency responses in many countries. In this crisis, what role can companies play? Public and private companies must continue to produce or provide their services, but with consideration of the health context. Many companies are involved with the COVID-19 outbreak because they are established in or work with China (client or supplier), and most have already activated their business continuity planning or equivalent. During an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19, most large companies around the world have a major part to play, especially in terms of preparedness and emergency response. Indeed, companies should be integrated into the governmental health contingency plan developed in many countries, and by WHO and the International Labor Organization. Helped by their occupational practitioners, healthcare advisers, and safety professionals, companies that have a financial capacity and responsibilities (including governmental, federal, or state administrations) will thus have to prepare their business continuity planning for when cases of infected patients occur in the company. They also must be prepared for the potential psychosocial and psychological effects of outbreaks. All health professionals should be involved in the development and implementation of recommendations for companies and their environments</p>
