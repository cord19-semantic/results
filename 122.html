<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases have stagnated in the last 20-30 years. Few major advances in clinical diagnostic testing have been made since the introduction of PCR, although new technologies are being investigated. Many tests that form the backbone of the "modern" microbiology laboratory are based on very old and labour-intensive technologies such as microscopy for malaria. Pressing needs include more rapid tests without sacrificing sensitivity, value-added tests, and point-of-care tests for both high-and low-resource settings. In recent years, research has been focused on alternative methods to improve the diagnosis of parasitic diseases. These include immunoassays, molecular-based approaches, and proteomics using mass spectrometry platforms technology. This review summarizes the progress in new approaches in parasite diagnosis and discusses some of the merits and disadvantages of these tests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Improved access to effective tests for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) has been designated a public health priority by the World Health Organisation. In high burden TB countries nucleic acid based TB tests have been restricted to centralised laboratories and specialised research settings. Requirements such as a constant electrical supply, air conditioning and skilled, computer literate operators prevent implementation of such tests in many settings. Isothermal DNA amplification technologies permit the use of simpler, less energy intensive detection platforms more suited to low resource settings that allow the accurate diagnosis of a disease within a short timeframe. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a rapid, low temperature isothermal DNA amplification reaction. We report here RPA-based detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) DNA in ,20 minutes at 39uC. Assays for two MTC specific targets were investigated, IS6110 and IS1081. When testing purified MTC genomic DNA, limits of detection of 6.25 fg (IS6110) and 20 fg (IS1081)were consistently achieved. When testing a convenience sample of pulmonary specimens from suspected TB patients, RPA demonstrated superior accuracy to indirect fluorescence microscopy. Compared to culture, sensitivities for the IS1081 RPA and microscopy were 91.4% (95%CI: 85, 97.9) and 86.1% (95%CI: 78.1, 94.1) respectively (n = 71). Specificities were 100% and 88.6% (95% CI: 80.8, 96.1) respectively. For the IS6110 RPA and microscopy sensitivities of 87.5% (95%CI: 81.7, 93.2) and 70.8% (95%CI: 62.9, 78.7) were obtained (n = 90). Specificities were 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1) and 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4) respectively. The superior specificity of RPA for detecting tuberculosis was due to the reduced ability of fluorescence microscopy to distinguish Mtb complex from other acid fast bacteria. The rapid nature of the RPA assay and its low energy requirement compared to other amplification technologies suggest RPA-based TB assays could be of use for integration into a point-of-care test for use in resource constrained settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Commercial multiplex assays, built on different chemistries and platforms are widely 25 available for simultaneous detection of pathogens that cause respiratory infections. However, 26 these tests are often difficult to implement in a resource limited setting because of high cost. In 27 this study, we developed and validated a method for simultaneous testing of common respiratory 28 pathogens (Respanel) by real-time PCR in a convenient, strip-tube array format. Primers and 29 probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following 30 optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-31 probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips. Nucleic acid extracts from specimens were 32 mixed with PCR master mix, and dispensed column-wise into 2X8-wells of a 96-well plate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Infectious diseases claim millions of lives each year. Robust and accurate diagnostics are essential tools for identifying those who are at risk and in need of treatment in low-resource settings. Inorganic complexes and metal-based nanomaterials continue to drive the development of diagnostic platforms and strategies that enable infectious disease detection in low-resource settings. In this review, we highlight works from the past 20 years in which inorganic chemistry and nanotechnology were implemented in each of the core components that make up a diagnostic test. First, we present how inorganic biomarkers and their properties are leveraged for infectious disease detection. In the following section, we detail metal-based technologies that have been employed for sample preparation and biomarker isolation from sample matrices. We then describe how inorganic-and nanomaterial-based probes have been utilized in point-ofcare diagnostics for signal generation. The following section discusses instrumentation for signal readout in resource-limited settings. Next, we highlight the detection of nucleic acids at the point of care as an emerging application of inorganic chemistry. Lastly, we consider the challenges that remain for translation of the aforementioned diagnostic platforms to low-resource settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Viral respiratory infections are common worldwide and range from completely benign disease to lifethreatening illness. Symptoms can be unspecific, and an etiologic diagnosis is rarely established because of a lack of suitable diagnostic tools. Improper use of antibiotics is common in this setting, which is detrimental in light of the development of bacterial resistance. It has been suggested that the use of diagnostic tests could reduce antibiotic prescription rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether access to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay panel for etiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) would have an impact on antibiotic prescription rate in primary care clinical settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Parasitic diseases not only cause millions of deaths per year, but also have serious health and economic consequences 1 . Among all the parasitic diseases, protozoan parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae are responsible for devastating diseases in humans, dogs as well as livestock, resulting in severe illness or even death if left untreated 1,2 . The protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and Leishmania spp. are the causative agents of Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis respectively 3 . Even though these diseases are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, in the last decades there has been a re-emergence also in developed countries, with international travel being responsible for increases in reported cases of Trypanosomatidae infections in non-endemic countries 1,4 . Consequently, these parasitic infections have become a more important public health issue of global relevance. Even though there are several methods available for the screening of parasitic infections, however, they have not yet changed dramatically the diagnosis in developing countries. Microscopic identification and parasite cultivation are still the primary diagnostic tools employed in many regions where Leishmaniasis is endemic 5 . These methods, unfortunately, require extended incubation times and are expensive, requiring specialized equipment and highly trained personnel 6 . On the other hand, standard serological approaches that could potentially prove to be timely and cost effective for diagnosing parasitic infections are of limited value, as most patients do not develop a significant antibody response 7 . In addition, and problematically for clinicians attempting to make an accurate diagnosis, T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. share various antigens that cause cross-reactivity in serological diagnosis when complex antigenic mixtures are used 8 . As a result, Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) methodologies have become valuable methods for the routine and accurate assessment of parasitic infectious diseases. NAT benefits from the presence of specific nucleic acid fragments for determining the presence/absence of pathogens 3,9-13 . There are different methods ranging from probe hybridization, amplification of genomic targets and sequencing of nucleic acid fragments. The use of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NAATs) such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), real-time PCR or Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) can be very useful in detecting infections and post-treatment monitoring 9,13,14 , including detection and distinguishing of parasites using single base resolution methods such as Single Base Extension (SBE). Primers are designed to hybridize to a complementary nucleic acid region such that the 3′ end of the primer finishes immediately before the nucleotide under interrogation 15 . However, while NAT has the advantage of being sensitive, there are some limitations, as the NAT methodologies have complex protocols, require technical expertise to run and interpret data (not cost-effective), and utilize equipment that is incompatible with use in remote and low-resource locations, such as developing countries where diagnostic laboratories are often poorly resourced and sparsely distributed 16 . Thus, there is an urgent need for early detection of infectious disease with improved, simple and low-cost alternative tests not requiring expensive laboratory equipment to be performed. To sum up, while laboratory-based models require benchtop laboratory facilities and complex procedures, Point-of-Care testing allows a more decentralized diagnostic analysis with additional advantages such as portability, automation, shorter time-to-results and lower cost [17] [18] [19] . The World Health Organization (WHO) is consistently encouraging developers to implement these new diagnostic technologies for improved effective clinical management and treatment of the major infections suitable in developing countries context 20,21 . These diagnostic devices should follow WHO criteria, the ASSURED acronym (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free and deliverable) 22,23 . Following this encouragement, Zhang et al. recently developed a low-cost CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx) for detecting DNA or RNA molecules of pathogenic species with single mismatch specificity 24,25 .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">While point-of-care (POC) diagnostic assays can be performed at or near the site of sample acquisition, they have for the most part been considered to be relatively simplistic tests that provide relatively little information to a clinician or public health worker. Familiar examples include electrochemical sensors for glucose, 1 or rapid immunoassays for metabolites such as human chorionic gonadotropin (the canonical pregnancy test), 2 and pathogens, either directly (influenza viruses) or via immune responses (antibodies against HIV-1/2). 3 The range of conditions and pathogens that could be tested for could likely be greatly expanded by developing POC diagnostics for nucleic acids 3 that would have greater sensitivity and accuracy. However, the current gold standard for molecular diagnostics, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), requires significant technical expertise and expensive and cumbersome equipment. Even portable instruments, such the Cepheid GeneXpert Omni, cost several thousand dollars and rely on expensive qPCR cartridge consumables for individual tests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The ability to make rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases broadly available in a portable, low-cost format would mark a great step forward in global health. Many molecular diagnostic assays are developed based on using thermal cyclers to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR for DNA and RNA amplification and detection, respectively. Unfortunately, most commercial thermal cyclers are expensive and need continuous electrical power supply, so they are not suitable for uses in low-resource settings. We have previously reported a low-cost and simple approach to amplify DNA using vacuum insulated stainless steel thermoses food cans, which we have named it thermos thermal cycler or TTC. Here, we describe the use of an improved set up to enable the detection of viral RNA targets by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), thus expanding the TTC's ability to identify highly infectious, RNA virus-based diseases in low resource settings. The TTC was successful in demonstrating high-speed and sensitive detection of DNA or RNA targets of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. Our innovative TTC costs less than $200 to build and has a capacity of at least eight tubes. In terms of speed, the TTC's performance exceeded that of commercial thermal cyclers tested. When coupled with low-cost endpoint detection technologies such as nucleic acid lateral-flow assay or a cell-phone-based fluorescence detector, the TTC will increase the availability of on-site molecular diagnostics in low-resource settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The sputum specimen pre-treatment procedures and protocols used to diagnose pathogens such as tuberculosis and pneumonia are complex and very labor intensive. The protocol involves liquefaction, homogenization, dissolution, and inactivation 11,12 . The pre-treatment methods for infectious sputum specimens currently used in most laboratories require not only daily preparation of reagents but also the process of opening and closing the lid for adding reagents, vortex mixing, and sedimentation using a centrifuge-all of which are done by hand 13,14 . Because there is a risk of infection during this sample pre-treatment process, the procedures must be carried out by experienced testers wearing special lab suits and masks in enclosed areas that can maintain constant negative pressure 15 . For some sputum specimens, a lysis reagent alone is not sufficient to liquefy and homogenize the sample, requiring mechanical dissolution through sonication. Gram-positive bacteria have a thicker peptidoglycan layer, and mycobacteria have complex glycolipids in their cell walls, making cell wall disruption more difficult than for other bacteria. To extract nucleic acids from these bacteria, methods such as boiling at 60-100 °C or high-energy bead beating are currently used to remove complex cell wall structures 13, 16 . Therefore, the sputum pre-treatment process presently used in the laboratory is a significant obstacle to on-site diagnosis of respiratory</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Besides the tests available today 19,26 , our group has recently reported the successful detection and differentiation of three Trypanosomatids species, by detecting Single Nucleotide Fingerprint (SNF) markers using a dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid reading (ChemNAT technology) 27,28 in combination with MALDI-ToF 29 . SNF markers are single nucleotide variations that occur at specific positions in conserved target nucleic acid sequences, allowing the differentiation of pathogenic species. As a result, these SNF represents the perfect target to be interrogated by the ChemNAT technology through the specific dynamic incorporation of aldehyde-modified SMART-Nucleobases into the abasic position of abasic PNA probes. Despite its high specificity, the use of this method has limitations, with higher cost and complex instrumentation (MALDI-ToF) required, making this approach unsuitable for diagnosis of parasitic infections in developing countries.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Data on grants for biomedical research by 10 major funders of health research were collected from the World RePORT platform to explore what is being funded, by whom and where. This analysis is part of the World Health Organization Global Observatory on Health Research and Development's work with the overall aim to enable evidence-informed deliberations and decisions on new investments in health research and development. The analysis expands on the interactive data visualisations of these data on the Observatory's website and describes the methods used to enable the categorisation of grants by health categories using automated data-mining techniques. Methods: Grants data were extracted from the World RePORT platform for 2016, the most recent year with data from all funders. A data-mining algorithm was developed in Java to categorise grants by health category. The analysis explored the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaborations between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with. Results: Out of a total of 69,420 grants in 2016, the United States of America's National Institutes of Health funded the greatest number of grants (52,928; 76%) and had the longest average grant duration (6 years and 10 months). Grants for research constituted 70.4% (48,879) of all types of grants, followed by grants for training (13,008; 18.7%) and meetings (2907; 4.2%). Of grant recipients by income group, low-income countries received only 0.2% (165) of all grants. Almost three-quarters of all grants were for non-communicable diseases (72%; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20%; 11,123), and injuries (6%; 3056). Only 1.1% of grants were for neglected tropical diseases and 0.4% for priority diseases on the WHO list of highly infectious (R&D blueprint) pathogens. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of considering funding decisions by other actors in future health research and capacity-strengthening decisions. This will not only improve efficiency and equity in allocating scarce resources but will also allow informed investment decisions that aim to support research on public health needs and neglected areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) have superior sensitivity, specificity, and rapid time to result compared to traditional microbiological methods. Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/ detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA-and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS.</p>
