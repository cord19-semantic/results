<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases have stagnated in the last 20-30 years. Few major advances in clinical diagnostic testing have been made since the introduction of PCR, although new technologies are being investigated. Many tests that form the backbone of the "modern" microbiology laboratory are based on very old and labour-intensive technologies such as microscopy for malaria. Pressing needs include more rapid tests without sacrificing sensitivity, value-added tests, and point-of-care tests for both high-and low-resource settings. In recent years, research has been focused on alternative methods to improve the diagnosis of parasitic diseases. These include immunoassays, molecular-based approaches, and proteomics using mass spectrometry platforms technology. This review summarizes the progress in new approaches in parasite diagnosis and discusses some of the merits and disadvantages of these tests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Systemic inflammation (SI), as indicated by clinical signs such as fever and increased respiratory and heart rates, can be due to a variety of underlying non-infectious or infectious causes including trauma, thermal burns, surgery, ischemia-reperfusion events and viral or bacterial infections. Patients presenting with SI can pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians in determining the underlying etiology; consequently it can be difficult to select the most appropriate options for treatment and patient management 1-5 . There is a clinical need for rapid diagnostic tests that can help clinicians distinguish between non-infectious, viral and bacterial etiologies of SI in (critically ill) patients. Without such tests, patients may be over-prescribed antibiotics when there is little clinical evidence of infection 4, 6 . Reducing inappropriate and unnecessary use of antibiotics, the concept of antibiotic stewardship, is essential in slowing the spread of resistant bacteria 7 .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: The diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains time-consuming and costly, the clinical tools lack specificity and a bedside test to exclude infection in suspected patients is unavailable. Breath contains hundreds to thousands of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that result from host and microbial metabolism as well as the environment. The present study aims to use breath VOC analysis to develop a model that can discriminate between patients who have positive cultures and who have negative cultures with a high sensitivity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) has emerged as an important public health problem in several rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Dengue is a very common acute infectious disease in the tropical world. Health care professionals are able to better care for dengue patients if they can make an early diagnosis and make a plan for case management. This current study investigated fever in 5729 children in Vietnam with 3 days or less of fever and identified 1692 dengue cases using advanced, gold standard methods. We systematically collected a range of medical and laboratory findings on each patient when they entered the study and used statistical tools to determine if these medical and laboratory findings could enable early diagnosis, independent of sophisticated, gold-standard laboratory tests. Our results, called the Early Dengue Classifier, had performance characteristics suggesting it could improve the diagnostic proficiency of health care professionals. However the performance of the Early Dengue Classifier is not perfect and likely will not change the practice of experienced doctors in dengue endemic settings. Our study highlights the need for 2 nd generation, easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests that can accurately diagnose dengue in the first few days of fever.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We developed a rapid method to process large volumes of stool for downstream testing by the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) TB-detection assay. The method was tested and optimized on stool samples spiked with known numbers of M. tuberculosis colony forming units (CFU), and stools from M. tuberculosis-infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Performance was scored on number of positive Xpert tests, the cycle thresholds (Cts) of the Xpert sample-processing control (SPC), and the Cts of the M. tuberculosis-specific rpoB probes. The method was then validated on 20 confirmed TB cases and 20 controls in Durban, South Africa.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is set to become the leading cause of neurological disability across all age groups. Currently, no reliable biomarkers exist to help diagnose the severity of TBI to identify patients who are at risk of developing secondary injuries. Thus, the discovery of reliable biomarkers for the management of TBI would improve clinical interventions. Inflammatory markers are particularly suited for biomarker discovery as TBI leads to very early alterations in inflammatory proteins. Using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation assay, we measured in patients that had suffered mild TBI (n = 10) or severe TBI (n = 10) with extra-cranial injury or extracranial injury only (EC) (n = 10), 92 inflammationassociated proteins in serum obtained: <1 hr (within 1-hour), 4-12 hr and 48-72 hr post injury. Changes were compared to healthy volunteers (HV). Our results identified CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL as novel early biomarkers of TBI. CST5 identified patients with severe TBI from all other cohorts and importantly was able to do so within the first hour of injury. AXIN1 and TRAIL were able to discriminate between TBI and HV at <1 hr. We conclude that CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL are worthy of further study in the context of a pre-hospital or pitch-side test to detect brain injury.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Differentiating dengue patients from other acute febrile illness patients is a great challenge among physicians. Several dengue diagnosis methods are recommended by WHO. The application of specific laboratory tests is still limited due to high cost, lack of equipment, and uncertain validity. Therefore, clinical diagnosis remains a common practice especially in resource limited settings. Bayesian networks have been shown to be a useful tool for diagnostic decision support. This study aimed to construct Bayesian network models using basic demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients to diagnose dengue. Data of 397 acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients who visited the fever clinic of the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand, were used for model construction and validation. The two best final models were selected: one with and one without NS1 rapid test result. The diagnostic accuracy of the models was compared with that of physicians on the same set of patients. The Bayesian network models provided good diagnostic accuracy of dengue infection, with ROC AUC of 0.80 and 0.75 for models with and without NS1 rapid test result, respectively. The models had approximately 80% specificity and 70% sensitivity, similar to the diagnostic accuracy of the hospital's fellows in infectious disease. Including information on NS1 rapid test improved the specificity, but reduced the sensitivity, both in model and physician diagnoses. The Bayesian network model developed in this study could be useful to assist physicians in diagnosing dengue, particularly in regions where experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Alere i RSV is a novel rapid test which applies a nicking enzyme amplification reaction to detect respiratory syncytial virus in point-of-care settings. In this study, we evaluated the Alere i RSV assay by using frozen nasopharyngeal swab samples that were collected in viral transport medium from children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection during the 2015-2016 winter season. Alere i RSV assay results were compared to those for Altona RealStar RSV real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). We found that the overall sensitivity and specificity of the Alere i RSV test was 100% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 93% to 100%) and 97% (95% CI, 89% to 100%), respectively. Positive samples were identified within 5 to 7 min from sample collection. Overall, the Alere i RSV test performed well compared to the RT-PCR assay and has the potential to facilitate the detection of RSV in pointof-care settings.</p>

Unlike other 53 LAMP-based tests, our assays assure accuracy by coupling amplification with novel nucleic acid 54 strand displacement (OSD) probes that hybridize to specific sequences in LAMP amplification 55 products and thereby generate simple yes/no readout of fluorescence readable by human eye 56 and by off-the-shelf cellphones. To facilitate field use, we developed our assays so they are 57 compatible with crushed mosquito homogenate as the template, meaning no nucleic acid 58 extraction is required. In blinded tests using field collected mosquitoes, LAMP-OSD-cellphone 59 tests performed robustly to identify 29 of 30 Ae. aegypti even after 3 weeks of storage at 37 Â°C 60 while producing only one false positive out of 60 non-specific mosquitoes. Similarly, our assay 61 could identify Wolbachia in field-caught Aedes albopictus without producing any false positives. 62</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">C-reactive protein (CRP) and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) are associated with bacterial and viral infections, respectively. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study of adults and children with febrile upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid CRP/MxA immunoassay to identify clinically significant bacterial infection with host response and acute pathogenic viral infection. The reference standard for classifying URI etiology was an algorithm that included throat bacterial culture, upper respiratory PCR for viral and atypical pathogens, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, and bandemia. The algorithm also allowed for physician override. Among 205 patients, 25 (12.2%) were classified as bacterial, 53 (25.9%) as viral, and 127 (62.0%) negative by the reference standard. For bacterial detection, agreement between FebriDx and the reference standard was 91.7%, with FebriDx having a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 59-93%), specificity of 93% (89-97%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 63% (45-79%), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97% (94-99%). For viral detection, agreement was 84%, with a sensitivity of 87% (75-95%), specificity of 83% (76-89%), PPV of 64% (63-75%), and NPV of 95% (90-98%). FebriDx may help to identify clinically significant immune responses associated with bacterial and viral URIs that are more likely to require clinical management or therapeutic intervention, and has potential to assist with antibiotic stewardship.</p>
