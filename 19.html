<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The rapid identification of therapeutics is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for nCoV and the resulting disease has been severe with a high case-fatality rate. The clinical experience from SARS suggests that a number of interventions including ribavirin with and without corticosteroids 12-14 , ribavirin with protease inhibitors 15,16 and interferon (alfacon-1) with corticosteroids 17 may improve outcome, but a definitive treatment regimen was not clearly established 18 . Here we address the effectiveness in vitro of two antiviral drugs, interferon-a2b (IFN-a2b) and ribavirin, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately utilized in the clinic to benefit future cases.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">A longstanding and still-increasing threat to the effective treatment of infectious diseases is resistance to antimicrobial countermeasures. Potentially, the targeting of host proteins and pathways essential for the detrimental effects of pathogens offers an approach that may discover broad-spectrum anti-pathogen countermeasures and circumvent the effects of pathogen mutations leading to resistance. Here we report implementation of a strategy for discovering broad-spectrum host-oriented therapies against multiple pathogenic agents by multiplex screening of drugs for protection against the detrimental effects of multiple pathogens, identification of host cell pathways inhibited by the drug, and screening for effects of the agent on other pathogens exploiting the same pathway. We show that a clinically used antimalarial drug, Amodiaquine, discovered by this strategy, protects host cells against infection by multiple toxins and viruses by inhibiting host cathepsin B. Our results reveal the practicality of discovering broadly acting anti-pathogen countermeasures that target host proteins exploited by pathogens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The Human Viral Challenge (HVC) model has, for many decades, helped in the understanding of respiratory viruses and their role in disease pathogenesis. In a controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers removed from community exposure to other infections, this experimental model enables proof of concept work to be undertaken on novel therapeutics, including vaccines, immunomodulators and antivirals, as well as new diagnostics. Crucially, unlike conventional phase 1 studies, challenge studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints that then guide decisions on how to optimise subsequent field studies, as recommended by the FDA and thus licensing studies that follow. Such a strategy optimises the benefit of the studies and identifies possible threats early on, minimising the risk to subsequent volunteers but also maximising the benefit of scarce resources available to the research group investing in the research. Inspired by the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) now commonly applied in the preclinical phase, HVC studies allow refinement and reduction of the subsequent development phase, accelerating progress towards further statistically powered phase 2b studies. The breadth of data generated from challenge studies allows for exploration of a wide range of variables and endpoints that can then be taken through to pivotal phase 3 studies. We describe the disease burden for acute respiratory viral infections for which current conventional development strategies have failed to produce therapeutics that meet clinical need. The Authors describe the HVC model's utility in increasing scientific understanding and in progressing promising therapeutics through development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In 2015, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea, resulting from nosocomial transmission, and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-ofaddition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early-and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular 9 response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our 10 understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host 11 responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We used microarray analysis 12 to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory 13 viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, 14 PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect 15 peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued 16 to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses 17 elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon 18 response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense 19 genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative 20 approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to 21 discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results: Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. Conclusions: Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational, and provide evidence that the combination of topology and controllability analyses may be valuable for future efforts in drug target discovery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic 26 fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California 27 serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often 28 asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals 29 have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential 30 antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral 31 molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that 32 exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, 33 was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in 34 multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or 35 infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a 36 known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that 37 the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift 38 Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), 39 and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant 40 reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of 41 potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus 42 replication. 43 44 Importance 45 No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a newly identified human coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Currently, no effective drug exists to treat SARS-CoV infection. In this study, we investigated whether a panel of commercially available antiviral drugs exhibit in vitro anti-SARS-CoV activity. A drugscreening assay that scores for virus-induced cytopathic effects on cultured cells was used. Tested were 19 clinically approved compounds from several major antiviral pharmacologic classes: nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. Complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for interferon subtypes, β-1b, α-n1, α-n3, and human leukocyte interferon a. These findings support clinical testing of approved interferons for the treatment of SARS.</p>

Despite this, no controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of these agents were conducted. If a second global SARS outbreak occurred, clinicians would not have controlled data on which to base therapeutic decisions. We discuss the unique methodologic and logistical challenges faced by researchers who attempt to conduct controlled trials of therapeutic agents during an outbreak of a novel or unknown infectious pathogen. We draw upon our own experience in attempting to conduct a randomized controlled trial of ribavirin therapy for SARS and discuss the lessons learned. Strategies to facilitate future clinical trials during outbreaks of unknown or novel pathogens are also presented.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes serious illness worldwide that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no effective drugs approved for the treatment of JEV infection. Drug-repurposing screening is an alternative approach to discover potential antiviral agents. In this study, high-content screening (HCS) of a natural extracts library was performed, and two hit FDA-approved Na ϩ /K ϩ -ATPase inhibitors, ouabain and digoxin, were identified as having robust efficiency against JEV infection with the selectivity indexes over 1,000. The results indicated that ouabain and digoxin blocked the JEV infection at the replication stage by targeting the Na ϩ /K ϩ -ATPase. Furthermore, it was proven that ouabain significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by JEV in a BALB/c mouse model. This work demonstrated that Na ϩ /K ϩ -ATPase could serve as the target of treatment of JEV infection, and ouabain has the potential to be developed as an effective anti-JEV drug.</p>

Although these properties are well established, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. In this study, GA and GRA were tested for the ability to inhibit rotavirus replication in cell culture, toward a long term goal of discovering natural compounds that may complement existing vaccines. Methods: Epithelial cells were treated with GA or GRA various times pre-or post-infection and virus yields were measured by immunofluorescent focus assay. Levels of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in GRA treated cells were measured by immunoblot to determine if there was an effect of GRA treatment on the accumulation of viral protein.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Acute viral infections pose many practical challenges for the accurate assessment of the impact of novel therapies on viral growth and decay. Using the example of influenza A, we illustrate how the measurement of infection-related quantities that determine the dynamics of viral load within the human host, can inform investigators on the course and severity of infection and the efficacy of a novel treatment. We estimated the values of key infectionrelated quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies, conducted by Roche, as part of the oseltamivir trials. We calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities, symptom severity and body temperature. The greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve. Total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number. The most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection. We suggest laboratory experiments to obtain more precise estimates of virological quantities that can supplement clinical endpoint measurements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Recent infectious outbreaks highlight the need for platform technologies that can be quickly deployed to develop therapeutics needed to contain the outbreak. We present a simple concept for rapid development of new antimicrobials. The goal was to produce in as little as one week thousands of doses of an intervention for a new pathogen. We tested the feasibility of a system based on antimicrobial synbodies. The system involves creating an array of 100 peptides that have been selected for broad capability to bind and/or kill viruses and bacteria. The peptides are pre-screened for low cell toxicity prior to large scale synthesis. Any pathogen is then assayed on the chip to find peptides that bind or kill it. Peptides are combined in pairs as synbodies and further screened for activity and toxicity. The lead synbody can be quickly produced in large scale, with completion of the entire process in one week.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the main etiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Recent EV-71 outbreaks in Asia-Pacific were not limited to mild HFMD, but were associated with severe neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and brainstem encephalitis, which may lead to cardiopulmonary failure and death. The absence of licensed therapeutics for clinical use has intensified research into anti-EV-71 development. This review highlights the potential antiviral agents targeting EV-71 attachment, entry, uncoating, translation, polyprotein processing, virus-induced formation of membranous RNA replication complexes, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The strategies for antiviral development include target-based synthetic compounds, anti-rhinovirus and poliovirus libraries screening, and natural compound libraries screening. Growing knowledge of the EV-71 life cycle will lead to successful development of antivirals. The continued effort to develop antiviral agents for treatment is crucial in the absence of a vaccine. The coupling of antivirals with an effective vaccine will accelerate eradication of the disease.</p>
