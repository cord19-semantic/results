</div><br /><br /><br /><div class="card"><h3>The battle against SARS and MERS coronaviruses: Reservoirs and Animal Models</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In humans, infection with the coronavirus, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), induces acute respiratory failure, resulting in high mortality. Irregular coronavirus related epidemics indicate that the evolutionary origins of these two pathogens need to be identified urgently and there are still questions related to suitable laboratory animal models. Thus, in this review we aim to highlight key discoveries concerning the animal origin of the virus and summarize and compare current animal models.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In humans, cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterised by chronic infection, inflammation, airway remodelling, and mucus obstruction. A lack of pulmonary manifestations in CF mouse models has hindered investigations of airway disease pathogenesis, as well as the development and testing of potential therapeutics. However, recently generated CF animal models including rat, ferret and pig models demonstrate a range of well characterised lung disease phenotypes with varying degrees of severity. This review discusses the airway phenotypes of currently available CF animal models and presents potential applications of each model in airway-related CF research.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with complex etiologies and genetic architecture. Animal models have a critical role in understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Here we studied epilepsy utilizing a genetic reference population of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice with publicly available whole genome sequences. We measured multiple epilepsy traits in 35 CC strains, and we identified novel animal models that exhibit extreme outcomes in seizure susceptibility, seizure propagation, epileptogenesis, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We performed QTL mapping in an F2 population and identified seven novel and one previously identified loci associated with seizure sensitivity. We combined whole genome sequence and hippocampal gene expression to pinpoint biologically plausible candidate genes and candidate variants associated with seizure sensitivity. These resources provide a powerful toolbox for studying complex features of seizures and for identifying genes associated with particular seizure outcomes, and hence will facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Infectious diseases still remain one of the biggest challenges for human health. In order to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and develop effective diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, and preventive vaccines, a suitable animal model which can represent the characteristics of infectious is required. The Syrian hamster immune responses to infectious pathogens are similar to humans and as such, this model is advantageous for studying pathogenesis of infection including post-bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens, along with assessing the efficacy and interactions of medications and vaccines for those pathogens. This review summarizes the current status of Syrian hamster models and their use for understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen infection, in addition to their use as a drug discovery platform and provides a strong rationale for the selection of Syrian hamster as animal models in biomedical research. The challenges of using Syrian hamster as an alternative animal model for the research of infectious diseases are also addressed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">By their very nature, great advances in immunology are usually underpinned by experiments carried out in animal models and inbred lines of mice. Also, their corresponding knock-out or knock-in derivatives have been the most commonly used animal systems in immunological studies. With much credit to their usefulness, laboratory mice will never provide all the answers to fully understand immunological processes. Large animal models offer unique biological and experimental advantages that have been and continue to be of great value to the understanding of biological and immunological processes. From the identification of B cells to the realization that γδ T cells can function as professional antigen presenting cells, farm animals have contributed significantly to a better understanding of immunity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Animal models to study opiates are of growing interest. We have examined the short-term safety of buprenorphine implants in Fischer F344/NTac rats treated with excess doses of a cholesterol-triglyceride suspension of buprenorphine. A single injection of 0.65 mg/kg afforded clinically significant blood levels of analgesia for 3 days. Chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis values with 2-to 10-fold excess doses of the drug-lipid suspension were within normal limits. Histopathology findings were unremarkable. The skin and underlying tissue surrounding the drug injection were unremarkable. Here we report the results of a long-term follow-up study of female rats injected with 0.65 and 1.3 mg/kg. The 14-month evaluation showed no abnormal findings that could be attributed to the drug or lipid suspension. These results confirm the safety of cholesterol-triglyceride carrier systems for subcutaneous drug delivery in laboratory animals and suggest that this model may be used to study long-term effects of opiate therapy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Animal models are live subjects applied to translational research. They provide insights into human diseases and enhance biomedical knowledge. Livestock production has favored the pace of human social development over millennia. Today's society is more aware of animal welfare than past generations. The general public has marked objections to animal research and many species are falling into disuse. The search for an ideal methodology to replace animal use is on, but animal modeling still holds great importance to human health. Bone research, in particular, has unmet requirements that in vitro technologies cannot yet fully address. In that sense, standardizing novel models remains necessary and rabbits are gaining in popularity as potential bone models. Our aim here is to provide a broad overview of animal modeling and its ethical implications, followed by a narrower focus on bone research and the role rabbits are playing in the current scenario.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Due to their inability to generate a complete immune response, mice knockout for type I interferon (IFN) receptors (Ifnar -/-) are more susceptible to viral infections, and are thus commonly used for pathogenesis studies. This mouse model has been used to study many diseases caused by highly pathogenic viruses from many families, including the Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Henipaviridae, and Togaviridae. In this review, we summarize the findings from these animal studies, and discuss the pros and cons of using this model versus other known methods for studying pathogenesis in animals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Respiratory viral infections are strongly associated with asthma exacerbations. Rhinovirus is most frequently-detected pathogen; followed by respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus; enterovirus and coronavirus. In addition; viral infection; in combination with genetics; allergen exposure; microbiome and other pathogens; may play a role in asthma development. In particular; asthma development has been linked to wheezing-associated respiratory viral infections in early life. To understand underlying mechanisms of viral-induced airways disease; investigators have studied respiratory viral infections in small animals. This report reviews animal models of human respiratory viral infection employing mice; rats; guinea pigs; hamsters and ferrets. Investigators have modeled asthma exacerbations by infecting mice with allergic airways disease. Asthma development has been modeled by administration of virus to immature animals. Small animal models of respiratory viral infection will identify cell and molecular targets for the treatment of asthma.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) are rodent-borne hantaviruses that are the primary causes of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. The development of well characterized animal models of HTNV and PUUV infection is critical for the evaluation and the potential licensure of HFRS vaccines and therapeutics. In this study we present three animal models of HTNV infection (hamster, ferret and marmoset), and two animal models of PUUV infection (hamster, ferret). Infection of hamsters with a~3 times the infectious dose 99% (ID 99 ) of HTNV by the intramuscular and~1 ID 99 of HTNV by the intranasal route leads to a persistent asymptomatic infection, characterized by sporadic viremia and high levels of viral genome in the lung, brain and kidney. In contrast, infection of hamsters with~2 ID 99 of PUUV by the intramuscular or~1 ID 99 of PUUV by the intranasal route leads to seroconversion with no detectable viremia, and a transient detection of viral genome. Infection of ferrets with a high dose of either HTNV or PUUV by the intramuscular route leads to seroconversion and gradual weight loss, though kidney function remained unimpaired and serum viremia and viral dissemination to organs was not detected. In marmosets a 1,000 PFU HTNV intramuscular challenge led to robust seroconversion and neutralizing antibody production. Similarly to the ferret model of HTNV infection, no renal impairment, serum viremia or viral dissemination to organs was detected in marmosets. This is the first report of hantavirus infection in ferrets and marmosets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Animal models of human diseases are indispensable for dissecting disease pathophysiology and developing therapies. While mice have been extremely helpful in modeling human diseases, in some cases they are inadequate due to species-specific differences in the cell biology of the affected organ and/or the evolutionary divergence of their genome. The domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has proven an excellent species for modeling certain human diseases when mice have failed, and technologies for genetic engineering in ferrets have expanded the potential use of this species for human disease research. However, until now, techniques for generating transgenic and knockout ferrets have predominantly relied upon genetic manipulation of fibroblasts followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer 1,2 . Such an approach is labor intensive and expensive. More recently, both clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated approaches have been used to generate knockout ferrets 3,4 . Here, we present a rapid method for generating transgenic ferrets using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted insertion at the ROSA26 locus in ferret zygotes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a severely debilitating and often fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in immunosuppressed individuals caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV), a ubiquitous human pathogen. Demyelination results from lytically infected oligodendrocytes, whose clearance is impaired in the setting of depressed JCV-specific T cell-mediated CNS surveillance. Although mutations in the viral capsid and genomic rearrangements in the viral non-coding region appear to set the stage for PML in the immunosuppressed population, mechanisms of demyelination and CNS antiviral immunity are poorly understood in large part due to absence of a tractable animal model that mimics PML neuropathology in humans. Early studies using mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) in T cell-deficient mice demonstrated productive viral replication in the CNS and demyelination; however, these findings were confounded by spinal cord compression by virus-induced vertebral bone tumors. Here, we review current literature regarding animal models of PML, focusing on current trends in antiviral T cell immunity in non-lymphoid organs, including the CNS. Advances in our understanding of polyomavirus lifecycles, viral and host determinants of persistent infection, and T cell-mediated immunity to viral infections in the CNS warrant revisiting polyomavirus CNS infection in the mouse as a bona fide animal model for JCV-PML.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Although astrogliosis and microglia activation are characteristic features of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other central nervous system (CNS) lesions the exact functions of these events are not fully understood. Animal models help to understand the complex interplay between the different cell types of the CNS and uncover general mechanisms of damage and repair of myelin sheaths. The so called cuprizone model is a toxic model of demyelination in the CNS white and gray matter, which lacks an autoimmune component. Cuprizone induces apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes that leads to a robust demyelination and profound activation of both astrocytes and microglia with regional heterogeneity between different white and gray matter regions. Although not suitable to study autoimmune mediated demyelination, this model is extremely helpful to elucidate basic cellular and molecular mechanisms during de-and particularly remyelination independently of interactions with peripheral immune cells. Phagocytosis and removal of damaged myelin seems to be one of the major roles of microglia in this model and it is well known that removal of myelin debris is a prerequisite of successful remyelination. Furthermore, microglia provide several signals that support remyelination. The role of astrocytes during de-and remyelination is not well defined. Both supportive and destructive functions have been suggested. Using the cuprizone model we could demonstrate that there is an important crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia. In this review we focus on the role of glial reactions and interaction in the cuprizone model. Advantages and limitations of as well as its potential therapeutic relevance for the human disease MS are critically discussed in comparison to other animal models.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. There are four different serotypes of DENV [1] [2] [3] [4] . DENV is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and DENV infection causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DSS is fatal in 1%-2.5% of cases with intensive treatment, and the mortality rate increases to >20% in the absence of proper treatment [1]. Thus far, DENV infection has not been reported in South Korea, except in patients who have traveled to endemic areas, such as Asia-Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa, which are the major sited of dengue fever outbreaks. According to the World Health Organization, 40% of the world population lives in high-DENV areas. An estimated 390 million people are infected with DENV, and about 20,000 of them die each year [2]. In 2014, 113 cases of dengue fever were reported in Yoyogi park in central Tokyo [3] . Similarly, in Europe, from 2012 to 2013, more than 3,000 people were infected with DENV in Portuguese Madeira on the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, 2 and 17 cases of dengue fever in persons who had no previous travel abroad were reported in France and Croatia, respectively, which were the first known cases of self-occurrence in Europe since 1928 and suggest the possibility of a future DENV epidemic [4] . A. aegypti and A. albopictus, which spread DENV, mostly inhabit the tropics and subtropics. These mosquitoes also carry several other infectious viruses, such as Chikungunya, West Nile fever, and yellow fever viruses, which have already been imported into Europe and the Americas by cargo ships and airlines. In 2013, subtropical Dengue fever is a tropical endemic disease; however, because of climate change, it may become a problem in South Korea in the near future. Research on vaccines for dengue fever and outbreak preparedness are currently insufficient. In addition, because there are no appropriate animal models, controversial results from vaccine efficacy assessments and clinical trials have been reported. Therefore, to study the mechanism of dengue fever and test the immunogenicity of vaccines, an appropriate animal model is urgently needed. In addition to mouse models, more suitable models using animals that can be humanized will need to be constructed. In this report, we look at the current status of model animal construction and discuss which models require further development.</p>
