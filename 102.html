<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Since the Operation Lindbergh was performed in 2001, telecommunication technique, which demonstrated the feasibility of remote operation in this event, has played a significant role in medicine 1 . A model of combining network with medicine has unique features, which goes beyond the obstacle of long distance and enables people to have access to the latest medical resources. As a result, telemedicine, such as remote consultation and telesurgery, have developed fast in the last decade. We can envisage that telemedicine has a wider application value at places inconvenient for people to reach, such as earthquake zones, aircraft carriers, and nuclear polluted areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today's healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means "health care in cyberspace"for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locallyin neighborhoods, "minute clinics," and homesusing information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed networkfor example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven "pillars" of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Measurements and Main Results: We defined geographic access as the percentage of the state, region and national population with either direct or hospital-transferred access within one or two hours by air or ground transport. Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. However, this degree of geographic access required substantial interhospital transfer of patients, including up to two hours by air.</p>

However, there remains a need to further refine the concept of resilience so that health systems can simultaneously achieve sustainable transformations in healthcare practice and health service delivery as well as improve their preparedness for emergencies.</p>
