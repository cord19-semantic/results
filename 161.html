<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Since the Operation Lindbergh was performed in 2001, telecommunication technique, which demonstrated the feasibility of remote operation in this event, has played a significant role in medicine 1 . A model of combining network with medicine has unique features, which goes beyond the obstacle of long distance and enables people to have access to the latest medical resources. As a result, telemedicine, such as remote consultation and telesurgery, have developed fast in the last decade. We can envisage that telemedicine has a wider application value at places inconvenient for people to reach, such as earthquake zones, aircraft carriers, and nuclear polluted areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The SARS outbreak in 2003 pushed Toronto's health care system to its limits. Staffing shortages, transmission of SARS within the ICU, and the influx of critically ill SARS patients were some unique challenges to the delivery of critical care. Communication strategies were a key component in the critical care response to SARS. Regular teleconference calls, web-based training and education, and the rapid coordination of research studies were some of the initiatives developed within the Toronto critical care community during the SARS outbreak. Other critical care communities should consider their communication strategies in advance of similar events.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The science of syndromic surveillance is still very much in its infancy. While a number of syndromic surveillance systems are being evaluated in the US, very few have had success thus far in predicting an infectious disease event. Furthermore, to date, the majority of syndromic surveillance systems have been based primarily in emergency department settings, with varying levels of enhancement from other data sources. While research has been done on the value of telephone helplines on health care use and patient satisfaction, very few projects have looked at using a telephone helpline as a source of data for syndromic surveillance, and none have been attempted in Canada. The notable exception to this statement has been in the UK where research using the national NHS Direct system as a syndromic surveillance tool has been conducted.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Measurements and Main Results: We defined geographic access as the percentage of the state, region and national population with either direct or hospital-transferred access within one or two hours by air or ground transport. Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. However, this degree of geographic access required substantial interhospital transfer of patients, including up to two hours by air.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today's healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means "health care in cyberspace"for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locallyin neighborhoods, "minute clinics," and homesusing information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed networkfor example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven "pillars" of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background. The study objective was to investigate and synthesize available evidence relating to the psychological health of Emergency Dispatch Centre (EDC) operatives, and to identify key stressors experienced by EDC operatives. Methods. Eight electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, The Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched. All study designs were included, and no date limits were set. Studies were included if they were published in English, and explored the psychological health of any EDC operatives, across fire, police, and emergency medical services. Studies were excluded if they related solely to other emergency workers, such as police officers or paramedics. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A narrative synthesis was conducted, using thematic analysis. Results. A total of 16 articles were included in the review. Two overarching themes were identified during the narrative synthesis: 'Organisational and Operational Factors' and 'Interactions with Others'. Stressors identified included being exposed to traumatic calls, lacking control over high workload, and working in under-resourced and pressured environments. Lack of support from management and providing an emotionally demanding service were additional sources of stress. Peer support and social support from friends and family were helpful in managing work-related stress. Discussion. EDC operatives experience stress as a result of their work, which appears to be related to negative psychological health outcomes. Future research should explore the long-term effects of this stress, and the potential for workplace interventions to alleviate the negative impacts on psychological health.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Objective: To categorize and describe the public health informatics (PHI) and global health informatics (GHI) literature between 2012 and 2014. Methods: We conducted a semi-systematic review of articles published between January 2012 and September 2014 where information and communications technologies (ICT) was a primary subject of the study or a main component of the study methodology. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups. Results: A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications. The development of adequate infrastructure to support ICT remains a challenge, although we identified a small but growing set of articles that measure the impact of ICT on clinical outcomes. Discussion: There is evidence of growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. Yet the articles also illuminate the need for more primary research studies on what works and what does not as both searches yielded small numbers of primary, empirical articles. Conclusion: While the body of knowledge around PHI and GHI continues to mature, additional studies of higher quality are needed to generate the robust evidence base needed to support continued investment in ICT by governmental health agencies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) in dogs is often treated with antibiotics due to the potential risk of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood stream. However, recent studies indicate that antibiotics are not always necessary. According to the Danish antibiotic use guidelines for companion animals 2012, antibiotics are not recommended for routine treatment of AHDS but only indicated in hospitalized dogs with severely affected overall condition and signs of systemic inflammation (SIRS)/sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate severity of disease and outcome in hospitalized dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea that did not receive antibiotics. The study was performed as a retrospective, observational study based on information from medical records for dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, hospitalized at the University Hospital for Companion Animals during the period 25/2-2014 to 9/10-2018. Signalments, concurrent diseases, clinical disease at the time of hospitalization and during each consecutive day, treatment prior to and during hospitalization, days of hospitalization/euthanasia and laboratory results were registered for each patient. Clinical disease was scored according to the AHDS-scoring system from 0-18 and the number of SIRS criteria (tachycardia (HR > 120), tachypnea (RR > 40), hyper or hypothermia (T > 39.0 C or < 37.5 C), leucocytosis (WBC > 18*10 9 / L), leukopenia (WBC < 5*10 9 /L, band neutrophilia and/or hypoglycaemia [glucose <4 mmol/L]) were recorded. One-hundred and seventy-two dogs were excluded from the analysis due to suspected drug induced disease (vaccination(s) (N = 4), anaesthetics (N = 5), corticosteroids or NSAIDs (N = 81)), alimentary foreign body (N = 5) or treatment with antibiotics during hospitalization (N = 128). Of the 128 dogs, where an obvious cause for the diarrhoea were not found and that only received supportive treatment (intravenous fluid therapy N = 128; antiemetics N = 98; gastroprotectants N = 107), 98% survived to discharge (125/128 dogs). Two dogs were euthanized due to financial constraints and reluctance from the owner to proceed with further treatment due to advanced age and one brachycephalic dog suffered a respiratory crisis with respiratory arrest nonresponsive to resuscitation. The surviving 125 dogs were hospitalized for an average of 1.7 days (range 1-4 days) with a mean AHDS-score of 12 at hospitalization (range 4-16). The mean AHDS-score after 24 hours of hospitalization was 5.5 (range 0-14). 29% (37/128) of the ABSTRACTS 341 dogs met ≥2 SIRS criteria during hospitalization. None of the 128 dogs had a degenerative left-shift. These results suggest that antimicrobial therapy in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea may not always be necessary in dogs even when 2 or more SIRS-criteria are met. Recent studies have shown alterations in faecal bile acid (BA) profiles in dogs with chronic enteropathy, potentially contributing to clinical signs. The study aim was to assess faecal BA concentrations in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS-D) over time and to compare it to that of healthy control dogs (HC-D). Twenty-five AHDS-D and 53 HC-D were enrolled. Faecal BA concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on days 0, 2, 7, and 14 in AHDS-D, and on day 0 in HC-D. Statistical analysis was performed with Friedman test for comparison of BA over time in AHDS-D, and unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney-test for comparison between AHDS-D and HC-D (P < 0.05). On day 0, concentration of lithocholic acid was significantly lower in AHDS-D than in HC-D (p < 0.001). On day 2, total faecal BA were significantly increased in AHDS-D (p < 0.001) compared to HC-D. More precisely, primary BA were significantly increased in AHDS-D on day 2 (P = 0.034) with significantly higher concentration of cholic acid (p = 0.004), while secondary BA were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) with significantly lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid (p < 0.001) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (p < 0.001). Dogs in AHDS-D showed a significant decrease in total primary BA concentrations (P = 0.021) with significantly lower concentrations of cholic acid (P = 0.027) and deoxycholic acid (p = 0.021) on day 14 compared to day 2. In conclusion, AHDS-D show alterations in faecal BA profiles compared to HC-D. However, faecal BA profiles normalize rapidly suggesting that BA dysmetabolism does not seem to play a major role in the pathophysiology of AHDS. Pimobendan is frequently used off-label for treatment of cats with congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary hypertrophy cardiomyopathy (HCM). Concerns exist regarding the safety of pimobendan in the subset of cats with HCM and dynamic outflow tract obstruction (HOCM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of pimobendan in cats with CHF secondary to HOCM compared with nonobstructive HCM.</p>
