<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was based on rapid diagnosis coupled with effective patient isolation. We used uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R 0 to assess the role that model parameters play in outbreak control. The transmission rate and isolation effectiveness have the largest fractional effect on R 0 . We estimated the distribution of the reproductive number R 0 under perfect isolation conditions. The distribution lies in the interquartile range 0.19-1.08, with a median of 0.49. Even though the median of R 0 is <1, we found that 25% of our R 0 distribution lies at R 0 > 1, even with perfect isolation. This implies the need to simultaneously apply more than one method of control.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Many interventions for controlling airborne disease transmission have been studied, such as masks, hand hygiene, isolation, quarantine, vaccination, school closure, etc. [6, 7] . Building ventilation is known to be effective for reducing the spread of airborne diseases such as tuberculosis, SARS, smallpox, chicken pox, and influenza in single indoor environments [8-12], but has not been studied at the community level. Ventilation intervention decreases transmission probability by directing the flow of airborne infectious agents away from susceptible persons and/or by removing infectious agents from room air. Because it relies less on individual compliance, ventilation has an advantage over other non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., hand washing or mask use). But questions remain. Is ventilation as effective at the community level as other interventions?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, two major emergency disease-control measures were cremation of bodies and enforcement of quarantine for asymptomatic individuals suspected of being in contact with a positive case. Enforced by State-related actors, these were promoted as the only method to curtail transmissions as soon as possible. However, as with other harsh measures witnessed by Liberian citizens, in many cases those measures elicited uncontrolled negative reactions within the communities (stigma; fear) that produced, in some cases, the opposite effect of that intended.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Effectively controlling infectious diseases requires quantitative comparisons of quarantine, infection control precautions, case identification and isolation, and immunization interventions. We used contact network epidemiology to predict the effect of various control policies for a mildly contagious disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and a moderately contagious disease, such as smallpox. The success of an intervention depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the contact pattern between persons within a community. The model predicts that use of face masks and general vaccination will only moderately affect the spread of mildly contagious diseases. In contrast, quarantine and ring vaccination can prevent the spread of a wide spectrum of diseases. Contact network epidemiology can provide valuable quantitative input to public health decisionmaking, even before a pathogen is well characterized.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Much research in epidemiology has been focused on evaluating conventional methods of control strategies in the event of an epidemic or pandemic. Travel restrictions are often suggested as an efficient way to reduce the spread of a contagious disease that threatens public health, but few papers have studied in depth the effects of travel restrictions. In this study, we investigated what effect different levels of travel restrictions might have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">2 For vector-borne infections, such as dengue, attention has been focused on interventions to reduce larval, and ultimately adult, vector populations. Programs have attempted to achieve this via a range of chemical, biological and physical interventions to reduce vector populations, as well as trying to initiate behavioural change at the community level to prevent contact with the mosquito vectors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">T he 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a modern example of containing a global epidemic through traditional or nonmedical public health interventions. The interventions included finding and isolating case-patients; quarantining contacts; measures to "increase social distance," such as canceling mass gatherings and closing schools; recommending that the public augment personal hygiene and wear masks; and limiting the spread of infection by domestic and international travelers, by issuing travel advisories and screening travelers at borders. Some measures were implemented pursuant to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO); others were implemented by governments on their own initiative. A novel technology, infrared scanning, was used extensively in some countries to try to identify persons with fever at international borders and in public places. After the outbreaks, WHO sought information to help assess the effectiveness of interventions in preventing the transmission of SARS in the community and internationally. Of particular interest was information on the effectiveness of thermal scanning of travelers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">To understand whether community-based control activities will be effective and why requires us to look at the behavioural mechanisms through which these interventions work and the context in which they are based. Behavioural mechanisms operate through the experiences, beliefs and values of groups and individuals. These mechanisms are therefore dependent in part on the context in which they are used. This framework was used in a recent synthetic review of water and sanitation projects. 17 The framework is shown in Figure 1 .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Control of emerging infectious disease requires an effective response to surveillance data. Single measures such as the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs may be unavailable, unaffordable or not in sufficient quantity. The control of these infectious diseases in resource constrained settings is more likely to be influenced by community-based and behavioural change interventions as well as by strengthening of national and international commitment to their control. 13 Over the last decade there have been increased efforts to promote community-based infectious disease control.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Fifty-seven studies were included. Vector control interventions using copepods, environmental cleanup and education are effective and sustainable at reducing dengue in rural and urban communities, whilst insecticide spraying is effective in urban outbreak situations. Communitybased surveillance interventions can effectively identify avian influenza in backyard flocks, but have not been broadly applied. Outbreak control interventions for Nipah virus and SARS are effective but may not be suitable for ongoing control. Canine vaccination and education is more acceptable than culling, but still fails to reach coverage levels required to effectively control rabies. Contextual factors were identified that influence community engagement with, and ultimately effectiveness of, interventions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Community-based interventions to control the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, have focused on hygiene and respiratory etiquette to prevent human-to-human transmission. Many of these interventions have only been evaluated in a developed country context. Aledort et al. 16 and Jefferson et al. 13 undertook systematic reviews of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Both reviews found handwashing was effective whilst there was no evidence to support school/workplace closure. However, these findings are from a predominantly North American context and may not be generalisable to countries with limited access to safe water and sanitation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: It is widely accepted that influenza transmission dynamics vary by age; however methods to quantify the reproductive number by age group are limited. We introduce a simple method to estimate the reproductive number by modifying the method originally proposed by Wallinga and Teunis and using existing information on contact patterns between age groups. We additionally perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential impact of differential healthcare seeking patterns by age. We illustrate this method using data from the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in Gauteng Province, South Africa.</p>

Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of ,48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable.</p>
