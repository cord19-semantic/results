<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The overall crude incidence of ARDS was 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, and increased from 2.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 personyears during the study period. The age-adjusted incidence of ARDS was 15.19 per 100,000 person-years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 57.8%. In-hospital mortality decreased from 59.7% in 1997 to 47.5% in 2011 (P < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18-29 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (>80 years, P < 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period. Patients who died during hospitalization were older (69 AE 17 versus 62 AE 19, P < 0.001) and predominantly male (69.8% versus 65.3%, P < 0.001). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher medical costs (6421 versus 5825 US Dollars, P < 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (13 versus 19 days, P < 0.001) than patients who survived.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We provide the first large-scale epidemiological analysis of ARDS incidence and outcomes in Asia. Although the overall incidence was lower than has been reported in a prospective US study, this may reflect underdiagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition code and identification of only patients with more severe ARDS in this analysis. Overall, there has been a decreasing trend in in-hospital and 1year mortality rates in recent years, likely because of the implementation of lung-protective ventilation.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common among mechanically ventilated children and accompanies up to 30% of all pediatric intensive care unit deaths. Though ARDS diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, biological markers of acute lung damage have been extensively studied in adults and children. Biomarkers of inflammation, alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial disruption, disordered coagulation, and associated derangements measured in the circulation and other body fluids, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, have improved our understanding of pathobiology of ARDS. The biochemical signature of ARDS has been increasingly well described in adult populations, and this has led to the identification of molecular phenotypes to augment clinical classifications. However, there is a paucity of data from pediatric ARDS (pARDS) patients. Biomarkers and molecular phenotypes have the potential to identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes, and perhaps inform the development of targeted therapies for specific groups of patients. Additionally, because of the lower incidence of and mortality from ARDS in pediatric patients relative to adults and lack of robust clinical predictors of outcome, there is an ongoing interest in biological markers as surrogate outcome measures. The recent definition of pARDS provides additional impetus for the measurement of established and novel biomarkers in future pediatric studies in order to further characterize this disease process. This chapter will review the currently available literature and discuss potential future directions for investigation into biomarkers in ARDS among children.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Viral infections are an important cause of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Numerous viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A (H1N1) virus, have been implicated in the progression of pneumonia to ARDS; yet the incidence of progression is unknown. Despite acute and chronic morbidity associated with respiratory viral infections, particularly in "at risk" populations, treatment options are limited. Thus, with few exceptions, care is symptomatic. In addition, mortality rates for viral-related ARDS have yet to be determined. This review outlines what is known about ARDS secondary to viral infections including the epidemiology, the pathophysiology, and diagnosis. In addition, emerging treatment options to prevent infection, and to decrease disease burden will be outlined. We focused on RSV and influenza A (H1N1) viral-induced ARDS, as these are the most common viruses leading to pediatric ARDS, and have specific prophylactic and definitive treatment options.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening noncardiogenic circulatory disorder of the lungs associated with critical illnesses such as sepsis, trauma, and immune and collagen vascular disease. Its mortality rate is marginally improved with the best supportive care. The demise occurs due to progressive pulmonary hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe inflammation. Complement activation is a part of immune response against pathogen or insult in which membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed and eliminates microbes. If complement regulatory protein such as endothelial CD59 is underexpressed, MAC may also cause pulmonary vascular injury to the innocent bystander endothelial cell of host and provokes endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and pulmonary vascular microthrombosis, leading to ARDS.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Introduction: Pharmacological immunomodulatory interventions in 'acute respiratory distress syndrome' (ARDS) have been unsuccessful in clinical trials [1-3] despite promising results in preclinical studies using animals [4][5]. Poor phenotyping of patients could be responsible for these disappointing results. Objectives: We hypothesized that ARDS patients can be clustered based on concentrations of plasma biomarkers and that such biological endophenotypes are association with clinical outcomes. Methods: Patients were screened for presence of ARDS. Unbiased cluster analysis of plasma concentrations of 20 biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and endothelial activation at diagnosis of ARDS provided the endophenotypes. A decision tree was then used to predict cluster membership based on a more restricted set of biomarkers. The independent association of endophenotypes with ICU mortality was studied by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Three endophenotypes of ARDS were identified in 771 patients, which we named 'impassive' (N = 383), 'intermediate' (N = 224) and 'reactive' (N = 164), had mortality rates of 16 %, 26 % and 47 %, respectively (P < 0.01). Patients with a 'reactive' endophenotype were younger, had higher disease severity scores, more failing organs and more frequently had an indirect cause for ARDS than patients with an 'impassive' or 'intermediate' endophenotype. A 'reactive endophenotype' was independent from confounders associated with ICU mortality (OR 1.18 [95 % confidence interval: 1.09-1.28]). The concentration of interleukin 10, interleukin 8 and matrix metalloproteinase 8 were sufficient to predict the three endophenotypes. Conclusions: ARDS patients can be clustered into three biological endophenotypes, with different mortality rates. Three easy to measure biomarkers can be used to predict the endophenotype.</p>

</div><br /><br /><br /><div class="card"><h3>Molecular Sciences Pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and Early Immune-Modulator Therapy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by infectious insults, such as pneumonia from various pathogens or related to other noninfectious events. Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances. Therefore, treatment with early systemic immune modulators (corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin) as soon as possible may reduce aberrant immune responses in the potential stage of ARDS.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Measurements and Main Results: We defined geographic access as the percentage of the state, region and national population with either direct or hospital-transferred access within one or two hours by air or ground transport. Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. However, this degree of geographic access required substantial interhospital transfer of patients, including up to two hours by air.</p>
