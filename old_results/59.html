<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The present findings suggest that in order to offer robust assessments it is critically important to clarify in detail the natural history of a disease (e.g. including the serial interval) as well as heterogeneous patterns of transmission. In addition, given that human contact behavior probably influences transmissibility, individual countermeasures (e.g. household quarantine and maskwearing) need to be explored to construct effective non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in school aged children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) lead to increased morbidity and lung function decline. However, the effect of exacerbations in young children with CF is not fully understood. We sought to characterize the frequency and clinical impact of PEx in a pilot study of infants and pre-school aged children with CF. Methods: Thirty young children with CF [median (range) 1.5 years (0.2-4.9)] were prospectively followed for 2 years. Exacerbation frequency (hospitalizations and outpatient antibiotic use) was determined. Chest radiographs were performed at enrollment and study completion and assigned a Brasfield score. Lung function at age 7 years was assessed in a subset of children. The association between PEx frequency, chest radiograph score, and lung function was determined using Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Correlations with an absolute magnitude of 0.3 or greater were considered clinically significant. Results: Over 2 years, participants experienced a median of two PEx (range 0-13). Chest radiograph scores at enrollment and study completion were inversely associated with PEx frequency (R = −0.48 and R = −0.44, respectively). The association between frequency of PEx and lung function [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 )] at age 7 years was small (R = 0.20). Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) at 7 years was associated with more frequent PEx during the study (R = 0.44). Conclusions: Children with worse chest radiograph scores had more frequent PEx over the subsequent 2 years, suggesting a group of patients at higher risk for PEx. Frequent PEx in infants and young children with CF were not associated with lower FEV 1 and FVC at 7 years, although spirometry in this age group may not be a sensitive marker of mild lung disease and disease progression.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Clinical progression over time and cytokine profiles have not been well defined in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. We included 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in serial serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients presented with fever. The median time to defervescence was 18 days. Nine patients required oxygen supplementation and classified into severe group. In the severe group, chest infiltrates suddenly began to worsen around day 7 of illness, and dyspnea developed at the end of the first week and became apparent in the second week. Median time from symptom onset to oxygen supplementation was 8 days. The severe group had higher neutrophil counts during week 1 than the mild group (4,500 vs. 2,200/µL, P = 0.026). In the second week of illness, the severe group had higher serum levels of IL-6 (54 vs. 4 pg/mL, P = 0.006) and CXCL-10 (2,642 vs. 382 pg/mL, P < 0.001). IFN-α response was not observed in mild cases. Our data shows that clinical condition may suddenly deteriorate around 7 days of illness and the serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL-10 was significantly elevated in MERS-CoV patients who developed severe diseases.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Pulmonary exacerbations are common events in cystic fibrosis and have a profound impact on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Pulmonary exacerbation outcomes remain poor and a significant proportion of patients fail to recover their baseline lung function despite receiving aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics. This focused review provides an update on some of the recent advances that have taken place in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis as well as direction for future study.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results: The proposed method shows good performance in simulations. It is applied to estimate the crude incidence of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in groups defined by a genotype not available for everyone in a cohort of nearly 2000 patients, where death due to toxicity acted as a competing event. In a second example the aim was to estimate engagement in care of a cohort of HIV patients in resource limited setting, where for some patients the outcome itself was missing due to lost to follow-up. A sampling based approach was used to identify outcome in a subsample of lost patients and to obtain a valid estimate of connection to care. Conclusions: A valid estimator for cumulative incidence of events accounting for competing risks under a general sampling design from an infinite target population is derived.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can experience 'exacerbations' of their conditions. An exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms, namely dyspnoea, cough and sputum that worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management. There is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity and that can be used as a surrogate to assess treatment effects in clinical studies. Little is known as to how existing study variables and suggested markers change in both the stable and exacerbation phases of COPD. In an attempt to find the best surrogates for exacerbations, we have reviewed the literature to identify which of these markers change in a consistent manner with the severity of the exacerbation event.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through RNA tests, serologic response, and viral culture. Of 537 specimens from patients in whom SARS was clinically diagnosed, 332 (60%) had SARS-CoV RNA in one or more clinical specimens, compared with 1 (0.3%) of 332 samples from controls. Of 417 patients with clinical SARS from whom paired serum samples were available, 92% had an antibody response. Rates of viral RNA positivity increased progressively and peaked at day 11 after onset of illness. Although viral RNA remained detectable in respiratory secretions and stool and urine specimens for >30 days in some patients, virus could not be cultured after week 3 of illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs, or sputum samples were the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness, but later in the illness viral RNA could be detected more readily in stool specimens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Conclusions: There has been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural history of the infection. There have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease. Terms such as ''camel exposure'' and the epidemiological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database. Coronaviruses will likely continue to emerge, arguing for a unified ''One Health'' approach.</p>

However, estimating VES is resource-intensive. We aim to identify methods to accurately estimate VES when limited information is available and resources are constrained. We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.</p>
