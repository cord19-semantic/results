<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The nature and scale of this economic shock have caused concerns that pandemic infl uenza could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Understanding the factors that lead persons to take preventive actions to avoid infection may help forecast the possible course of an epidemic and its economic effect. This information would help decision-makers give appropriate advice to limit individual, community health, and economic effects.</p>

</div><br /><br /><br /><div class="card"><h3>Precautionary Behavior in Response to Perceived Threat of Pandemic Infl uenza</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The demand for certain goods and services may decline, and output may be reduced if persons avoid work or social interactions and associated purchase of goods. The economic effect of such precautionary actions may be substantial. For instance, the economic effect of SARS has been estimated at US $30-$100 billion (3-5), although the outbreak was confi ned to a few months and <10,000 persons were infected. Macroeconomic estimates suggest that the indirect general demand-reducing effect of SARS in nonhealth sectors was greater than the direct health effect and associated productivity losses to SARS patients and their families (6).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The spread of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (H5N1) and the documented illness and deaths of >300 persons in >12 countries (7) has heightened concerns that an infl uenza pandemic may be imminent. The effect of efforts to limit the dramatic health and economic consequences of such a pandemic will depend on how persons react. Research on public reaction to previous outbreaks has shown that persons may take misjudged precautionary actions (e.g., avoid places and activities that bear low risk for infection, avoid healthcare facilities for fear of infection, refuse to comply with quarantine efforts) that may contribute to the pandemic's adverse economic effect (8). Therefore, to improve communication efforts by health offi cials, to enable pandemic containment, and to avoid unwarranted losses to the economy, knowledge of how per-</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Although public health guidelines have implications for resource allocation, these issues were not explicitly considered in previous WHO pandemic preparedness and response guidance. In order to ensure a thorough and informed revision of this guidance following the H1N1 2009 pandemic, a systematic review of published and unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics was conducted.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Our findings suggest that small and medium businesses in Australia are not currently well prepared for pandemic influenza. We found that beliefs about the risk, severity, and the ability to respond effectively to the threat of pandemic influenza are important predictors of preparedness. Campaigns targeting small and medium businesses should emphasise the severity of the consequences to their businesses if a pandemic were to occur, and, at the same time, reassure them that there are effective strategies capable of being implemented by small and medium businesses to deal with a pandemic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We estimated the impact on the US export economy of an illustrative infectious disease outbreak scenario in Southeast Asia that has 3 stages starting in 1 country and, if uncontained, spreads to 9 countries. We used 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic-related World Bank estimates of 3.3% and 16.1% reductions in gross domestic product (GDP). We also used US Department of Commerce job data to calculate export-related jobs at risk to any outbreak-related disruption in US exports. Assuming a direct correlation between GDP reductions and reduced demand for US exports, we estimated that the illustrative outbreak would cost from approximately $13 million to approximately $64 million (1 country) to $8 billion to $41 billion (9 countries) and place 1,500 to almost 1.4 million export-related US jobs at risk. Our analysis illustrates how global health security is enhanced, and the US economy is protected, when public health threats are rapidly detected and contained at their source.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results: Approximately 6 per cent of participants reported that their business had a plan for pandemic influenza, 39 per cent reported that they had not thought at all about the impact of pandemic influenza on their business, and over 60 per cent stated that they required help to prepare for a pandemic. Beliefs about the severity of pandemic influenza and the ability to respond were significant independent predictors of having a plan for pandemic influenza, and the perception of the risk of pandemic influenza was the most important predictor of both having considered the impact of, and needing help to prepare for a pandemic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We report the results of a national survey conducted to help public health offi cials understand the public's response to community mitigation interventions for a severe outbreak of pandemic infl uenza. Survey results suggest that if community mitigation measures are instituted, most respondents would comply with recommendations but would be challenged to do so if their income or job were severely compromised. The results also indicate that community mitigation measures could cause problems for persons with lower incomes and for racial and ethnic minorities. Twentyfour percent of respondents said that they would not have anyone available to take care of them if they became sick with pandemic infl uenza. Given these results, planning and public engagement will be needed to encourage the public to be prepared.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">T he risk of acquiring an infectious disease may stimulate persons to take precautionary actions to try to reduce this risk as they perceive it. The potential effect of this perceived risk-induced behavior was apparent during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. For example, use of public transportation in affected areas and international fl ights to these areas were reduced dramatically (1,2). Precautionary actions, such as avoiding public transportation or avoiding situations in which persons congregate, may have potential epidemiologic effects and would be expected to have economic consequences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The recent spread of highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza has highlighted the threat posed by pandemic influenza. In the early phases of a pandemic, the only treatment available would be neuraminidase inhibitors, which many countries are considering stockpiling for pandemic use. We estimate the effect on hospitalization rates of using different antiviral stockpile sizes to treat infection. We estimate that stockpiles that cover 20%-25% of the population would be sufficient to treat most of the clinical cases and could lead to 50% to 77% reductions in hospitalizations. Substantial reductions in hospitalization could be achieved with smaller antiviral stockpiles if drugs are reserved for persons at high risk.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Although border quarantine is included in many influenza pandemic plans, detailed guidelines have yet to be formulated, including considerations for the optimal quarantine length. Motivated by the situation of small island nations, which will probably experience the introduction of pandemic influenza via just one airport, we examined the potential effectiveness of quarantine as a border control measure.</p>
