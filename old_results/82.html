<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) in Western Africa highlighted the need for anti-EBOV therapeutics. Clomiphene is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that blocks EBOV entry and infection in cells and significantly protects EBOV-challenged mice. As provided, clomiphene is, approximately, a 60:40 mixture of two stereoisomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene. The pharmacokinetic properties of the two isomers vary, but both accumulate in the eye and male reproductive tract, tissues in which EBOV can persist. Here we compared the ability of clomiphene and its isomers to inhibit EBOV using viral-like particle (VLP) entry and transcription/replication-competent VLP (trVLP) assays. Clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of VLPs and trVLPs with similar potencies. This was demonstrated with VLPs bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses (EBOV Mayinga, EBOV Makona, and Marburg virus) and in two cell lines (293T/17 and Vero E6). Visual problems have been noted in EBOV survivors, and viral RNA has been isolated from semen up to nine months post-infection. Since the clomiphene isomers accumulate in these affected tissues, clomiphene or one of its isomers warrants consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, for example, to potentially help ameliorate symptoms in EBOV survivors. 2 of 15 basis; these included the ZMapp cocktail of monoclonal antibodies [7, 8] , hyperimmune serum [9,10], and several low molecular weight anti-viral drugs [11] [12] [13] . Additional therapeutic antibodies [14] [15] [16] [17] have recently been described, and two novel low molecular weight viral RNA polymerase inhibitors are in development [18, 19] . A different approach has been to screen U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity, with the goal of repurposing an approved drug, or combination of approved drugs, for use as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic in the advent of a future outbreak [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Clomiphene surfaced in two independent screens of FDA-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity [20] [21] [22] ; it blocks EBOV entry and infection in tissue culture cells and provides up to 90% protection in the mouse model of EBOV disease [20, 21] . Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat female infertility due to anovulation [25] [26] [27] . It was also proposed in 1991 as a drug to reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels [28] , and is currently used off-label for men with hypogonadism. We found, however, that clomiphene exerts its anti-EBOV activity in cell cultures irrespective of expression of the estrogen receptor alpha and/or beta subunits [20] . Instead, clomiphene likely exerts its anti-EBOV activity because it is a cationic amphiphilic drug [29] that accumulates in endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion and cytoplasmic entry [30] [31] [32] . Similar to other cationic amphiphilic drugs [29, 33] , clomiphene blocks a late step in the complex process by which the EBOV genome gains access to the host cell cytoplasm to initiate replication, most likely by blocking fusion between the EBOV and endolysosomal membranes [29] .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the PBM (SB203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Patients with severe viral infections are often hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) and recent studies underline the frequency of viral detection in ICU patients. Viral infections in the ICU often involve the respiratory or the central nervous system and can cause significant morbidity and mortality especially in immunocompromised patients. The mainstay of therapy of viral infections is supportive care and antiviral therapy when available. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection has provided great potential for the discovery of new antiviral agents that target viral proteins or host proteins that regulate immunity and are involved in the viral life cycle. These novel treatments need to be further validated in animal and human randomized controlled studies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Favipiravir (T-705) is a nucleoside precursor that has been approved for treatment of pandemic influenza in Japan [14, 18, 19] . Intracellular phosphoribosylation yields a triphosphate form (T-705-RTP) that is accommodated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Figure 1) [20]. Experiments with recombinant influenza RdRp show ambiguous base-pairing with both cytidine and uridine, which can lead to lethal mutagenesis [21] . Incorporation of the T-705-RTP into the growing RNA chain can also cause moderate inhibition of RNA synthesis. Favipiravir is active against a large panel of RNA viruses in vitro, including EBOV [12, 22, 23] . The clinical evaluation has been challenging and results of a multicenter non-randomized trial were largely inconclusive [24] . The structure of the base moiety and proposed mechanism of action are reminiscent of ribavirin that has been used for over a decade to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Figure 1 ) [25] [26] [27] [28] . A structurally distinct broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is also active against EBOV in vitro is galidesivir (BCX4430) [11] . Galidesivir is an adenosine-like compound with a nitrogen-substituted sugar ring that likewise requires intracellular activation to the TP form (Figure 1) . Biochemical experiments show that this compound serves as a substrate for the RdRp of HCV and causes chain termination following its incorporation [11] .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">: Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of general population from emerging and reemerging viral diseases reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we reviewed discovery and development of BSAAs and summarized the information on 119 safe-in-man agents in freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Many viral pathogens encode the motor proteins named RNA helicases which display various functions in genome replication. General strategies to design specific and selective drugs targeting helicase for the treatment of viral infections could act via one or more of the following mechanisms: inhibition of the NTPase activity, by interferences with ATP binding and therefore by limiting the energy required for the unwinding and translocation, or by allosteric mechanism and therefore by stabilizing the conformation of the enzyme in low helicase activity state; inhibition of nucleic acids binding to the helicase; inhibition of coupling of ATP hydrolysis to unwinding; inhibition of unwinding by sterically blocking helicase translocation. Recently, by in vitro screening studies, it has been reported that several benzotriazole, imidazole, imidazodiazepine, phenothiazine, quinoline, anthracycline, triphenylmethane, tropolone, pyrrole, acridone, small peptide, and Bananin derivatives are endowed with helicase inhibition of pathogen viruses belonging to Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae families.</p>

If both RBV regimens fail, pegIFN-α can be administrated, but is only suited for the subset of liver-transplant recipients [12] [13] [14] [15] . Thus, RBV is the treatment of choice but leads to viral clearance in only 80% of patients treated [16] . Similar to pegIFN-α, it is contraindicated in the major risk group of pregnant women, emphasizing the importance of new therapy options.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic 26 fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California 27 serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often 28 asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals 29 have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential 30 antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral 31 molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that 32 exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, 33 was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in 34 multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or 35 infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a 36 known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that 37 the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift 38 Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), 39 and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant 40 reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of 41 potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus 42 replication. 43 44 Importance 45 No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Viral diseases remain serious threats to public health because of the shortage of effective means of control. To combat the surge of viral diseases, new treatments are urgently needed. Here we show that small-molecules, which inhibit cellular anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2i), induced the premature death of cells infected with different RNA or DNA viruses, whereas, at the same concentrations, no toxicity was observed in mock-infected cells. Moreover, these compounds limited viral replication and spread. Surprisingly, Bcl-2i also induced the premature apoptosis of cells transfected with viral RNA or plasmid DNA but not of mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that Bcl-2i sensitizes cells containing foreign RNA or DNA to apoptosis. A comparison of the toxicity, antiviral activity, and side effects of six Bcl-2i allowed us to select A-1155463 as an antiviral lead candidate. Thus, our results pave the way for the further development of Bcl-2i for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Pharmaceuticals 2019, 12, 97 2 of 11 in nervous tissues [6] . Currently, there are two major lines of investigation for the development of antivirals against ZIKV: (i) The search for Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) that are based on interference with viral components (e.g., inhibitors of fusion, viral protease, or RNA dependent RNA polymerase); (ii) The identification of Host-Directed Antivirals (HDAs) that inhibit host factors co-opted for the virus to complete its infectious cycle. Theoretically, HDAs carry the advantage that they are less prone to the selection of resistant mutants, which could lead to the identification of broad-spectrum antivirals that are effective against taxonomically-related viruses [7] [8] [9] . During the last years, the knowledge on virus-host interactions has exponentially grown, revealing that the life cycle of many viruses, including ZIKV, is dependent upon host lipid metabolism [10, 11] . This valuable information has unveiled potential antiviral targets that are now starting to be explored. It is expected that the detailed knowledge of the metabolic alterations (e.g., lipid metabolism) during ZIKV and other arboviral infections could help to design novel therapeutics, but also be useful to the identification of molecular biomarkers suitable for improved diagnostic [12] . This review summarizes the principal findings and the current status on the progress of the development of drugs that interfere with lipid metabolism and function as antivirals against ZIKV.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Rotavirus infection is a major cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants younger than 5 y old and in particular cases of immunocompromised patients irrespective to the age of the patients. Although vaccines have been developed, antiviral therapy is an important complement that cannot be substituted. Because of the lack of specific approved treatment, it is urgent to facilitate the cascade of further understanding of the infection biology, identification of druggable targets and the final development of effective antiviral therapies. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role in regulating the infection course of many viruses. In this study, we have dissected the effects of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway on rotavirus infection using both conventional cell culture models and a 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids. We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is essential in sustaining rotavirus infection. Thus, blocking the key elements of this pathway, including PI3K, mTOR and 4E-BP1, has resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity. Importantly, a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, potently inhibited both experimental and patient-derived rotavirus strains. This effect involves 4E-BP1 mediated induction of autophagy, which in turn exerts anti-rotavirus effects. These results revealed new insights on rotavirus-host interactions and provided new avenues for antiviral drug development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses are among the most common viruses causing mild seasonal colds. These RNA viruses can also cause lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at greatest risk for serious disease associated with these RNA virus respiratory infections. In addition, swine and avian influenza viruses, together with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, represent significant pandemic threats to the general population. In this review, we describe the current medical need resulting from respiratory infections caused by RNA viruses, which justifies drug discovery efforts to identify new therapeutic agents. The RNA polymerase of respiratory viruses represents an attractive target for nucleoside and nucleotide analogs acting as inhibitors of RNA chain synthesis. Here, we present the molecular, biochemical, and structural fundamentals of the polymerase of the four major families of RNA respiratory viruses: Orthomyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae/Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae. We summarize past and current efforts to develop nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as antiviral agents against respiratory virus infections. This includes molecules with very broad antiviral spectrum such as ribavirin and T-705 (favipiravir), and others targeting more specifically one or a few virus families. Recent advances in our understanding of the structure(s) and function(s) of respiratory virus polymerases will likely support the discovery and development of novel nucleoside analogs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Clomiphene citrate, the clinically-administered drug and the formulation tested to date for anti-EBOV activity, is a mixture of two diastereoisomers:~60% trans-clomiphene (enclomiphene) and 40% cis-clomiphene (zuclomiphene). Whereas enclomiphene exhibits high anti-estrogenic properties, zuclomiphene does not [34] [35] [36] . The two isomers also differ in other pharmacokinetic properties. For examples, zuclomiphene has a longer half-life in serum [37, 38] and persists in most tissues for longer periods of time than enclomiphene [39] . It could, therefore, be proposed that zuclomiphene is the major contributor to adverse side effects seen in individuals given clomiphene citrate and, conversely, that enclomiphene would impart fewer side effects [39, 40] . Due to these features, as well as its ability to raise testosterone levels, enclomiphene is currently in clinical development as a treatment for secondary hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) [41] .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), which is a novel bunyavirus. SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6-30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10 6 copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2 ′ -fluoro-2 ′ -deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area. Here we summarize and discuss recent advances in antiviral drugs against SFTSV.</p>
