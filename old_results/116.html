<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results: In this study, a novel reporter virus-based system was developed for measuring neutralization and ADE activity. A stable Renilla luciferase reporter DENV (Luc-DENV) that can produce robust luciferase signals in BHK-21 and K562 cells were used to establish the assay and validated against traditional plaque-based assay. Luciferase value analysis using various known DENV-specific monoclonal antibodies showed good repeatability and a well linear correlation with conventional plaque-based assays. The newly developed assay was finally validated with clinical samples from infected animals and individuals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Over the last decade alone, the global burden of dengue has doubled, with an estimated 50 to 100 million symptomatic cases annually 1 . The risk of severe disease is augmented when dengue virus (DENV) is opsonized with non-or sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies that ligate Fc-gamma receptors (Fcγ Rs) for enhanced entry and replication in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. This phenomenon, termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), engenders the elevated viraemia and vascular leakage that is characteristic of severe dengue. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated ADE clinically and identified how this process could be exploited to enhance live attenuated viral vaccination 2 .</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Dengue virus (DENV) still poses a global public health threat, and no vaccine or antiviral therapy is currently available. Antibody plays distinct roles in controlling DENV infections. Neutralizing antibody is protective against DENV infection, whereas sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody can increase DENV infection, termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Plaque-based assay represents the most widely accepted method measuring neutralizing or enhancing antibodies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Since 2015, DENV's cousin known as ZIKV has been in the spotlight. It caught researchers' attention because it rapidly spread worldwide and ZIKV infection has been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome cases and congenital brain abnormalities in newborn infants. For being so closely related, differentiation between DENV or ZIKV infection is challenging. Among the assays used in viral serological diagnosis, the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that was described in the 1950s seems to be more specific, although PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.Funding: CNDS received financial support from BNDES, Fundação Araucária (fellowships), CNPq and CAPES (all Brazilian Governmental agencies) for funding the research. Nevertheless, the funding for publication fees is very limited. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and longstanding, very laborious and not capable to test large number of samples. Therefore, we developed an image based neutralization test for ZIKV that overcomes restrictions presented by PRNT. This new test is faster, robust and able to test many samples simultaneously. It was successful in distinguish ZIKV infection from other infections, such as dengue and yellow fever. This may be especially relevant to solve cases such as congenital disorders in newborns and also to elucidate the agents involved in neuropathological outcomes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. It also can be useful in serological surveys and vaccine studies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Zika virus is spread mainly by the bite of an infected mosquito, which can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, thus leading to birth defects including more than microcephaly. It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika in the near future, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the key role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Taken together, our data suggested that SARS-CoV is able to enter human immune cells via an antibodymediated pathway and immunological consequences of such infection are under investigation (productive replication, cytokines secretion profile and cell death etc). Our data raise reasonable concerns regarding the use of SARS-CoV vaccine in humans and pave the way to further studies focusing on the role of immune-mediated infection phenomenon during SARS pathogenesis.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce inflammation in immunoprivileged organs (e.g., the brain and testis), leading to the Guillain-Barré syndrome and damaging the testes. During an infection with the ZIKV, immune cells have been shown to infiltrate into the tissues. However, the cellular mechanisms that define the protection and/or immunopathogenesis of these immune cells during a ZIKV infection are still largely unknown. Herein, we describe methods to evaluate the virus-specific T-cell functionality in these immunoprivileged organs of ZIKV-infected mice. These methods include a) a ZIKV infection and vaccine inoculation in Ifnar1 -/mice; b) histopathology, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry assays to detect the virus infection and inflammation in the brain, testes, and spleen; c) the preparation of a tetramer of ZIKV-derived T-cell epitopes; d) the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in the monocytes isolated from the brain, testes, and spleen. Using these approaches, it is possible to detect the antigen-specific T cells that have infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs and to evaluate the functions of these T cells during the infection: potential immune protection via virus clearance and/or immunopathogenesis to exacerbate the inflammation. These findings may also help to clarify the contribution of T cells induced by the immunization against ZIKV.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">V920, rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP, is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis-Zaire ebolavirus vaccine which has shown an acceptable safety profile and provides a protective immune response against Ebola virus disease (EVD) induced by Zaire ebolavirus in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the V920 vaccine is capable of replicating in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species and of replicating in live mosquitoes. While the V920 vaccine replicated well in Vero cells, no replication was observed in Anopheles or Aedes mosquito, Culicoides biting midge, or Lutzomyia sand fly cells, nor in live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes following exposure through intrathoracic inoculation or feeding on a high-titer infectious blood meal. The insect taxa selected for use in this study represent actual and potential epidemic vectors of VSV. V920 vaccine inoculated into Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes demonstrated persistence of replication-competent virus following inoculation, consistent with the recognized biological stability of the vaccine, but no evidence for active virus replication in live mosquitoes was observed. Following administration of an infectious blood meal to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes at a titer several log 10 PFU more concentrated than would be observed in vaccinated individuals, no infection or dissemination of V920 was observed in either mosquito species. In vitro and in vivo data gathered during this study support minimal risk of the vector-borne potential of the V920 vaccine.</p>

While the mechanism of interference is not resolved in this study, these results suggest it is not caused by direct competition between non-AMA1 IgG and AMA1 protein. This study indicates that antimalaria IgGs induced by natural exposure may interfere with the biological effect of antibody induced by an AMA1-based vaccine in the target population.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">There is an urgent need for potent inhibitors of dengue virus (DENV) replication for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of infections with this virus. We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drugaddition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In conclusion, LCTA-949 exerts in vitro activity against several flaviviruses and does so (as shown for DENV) by interfering with an early step in the viral replication cycle.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Zika virus (ZIKV) remained largely quiescent for nearly six decades after its first appearance in 1947. ZIKV reappeared after 2007, resulting in a declaration of an international "public health emergency" in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until this time, ZIKV was considered to induce only mild illness, but it has now been established as the cause of severe clinical manifestations, including fetal anomalies, neurological problems, and autoimmune disorders. Infection during pregnancy can cause congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly and neurological degeneration, and in other cases, Guillain-Barré syndrome, making infections with ZIKV a substantial public health concern. Genomic and molecular investigations are underway to investigate ZIKV pathology and its recent enhanced pathogenicity, as well as to design safe and potent vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics. This review describes progress in the design and development of various anti-ZIKV therapeutics, including drugs targeting virus entry into cells and the helicase protein, nucleosides, inhibitors of NS3 protein, small molecules, methyltransferase inhibitors, interferons, repurposed drugs, drugs designed with the aid of computers, neutralizing antibodies, convalescent serum, antibodies that limit antibody-dependent enhancement, and herbal medicines. Additionally, covalent inhibitors of viral protein expression and anti-Toll-like receptor molecules are discussed. To counter ZIKVassociated disease, we need to make rapid progress in developing novel therapies that work effectually to inhibit ZIKV.</p>
