<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Since the 9/11 attack and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the development of qualified and able public health leaders has become a new urgency in building the infrastructure needed to address public health emergencies. Although previous studies have reported that the training of individual leaders is an important approach, the systemic and scientific training model need further improvement and development. The purpose of this study was to develop, deliver, and evaluate a participatory leadership training program for emergency response.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In recent years, growth of international travel and trade, as well as climate change, has resulted in the frequent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and MERS. In 2016, Taiwan used the Joint External Evaluation ( JEE) tool to evaluate its public health emergency response capacities and understand important areas for improvement. This article presents Taiwan's disaster and public health emergency response organizational structure, realtime integrated information, response processes, and command center structure. After reviewing the results of the JEE tool and drawing lessons from emergency response efforts in the United States, we provide 3 recommendations that may enhance Taiwan's public health emergency response capacities: establish common principles for disaster response regardless of which agency is in charge, standardize operation procedures, and perform regular training that includes nongovernmental organizations and a range of government departments.</p>

Although regional cultural differences were observed, these differences will not prevent countries from coming together to collectively address a shared existential health threat. Pandemics create a global predicament that can unite countries around the shared value of health, rather than divide on the basis of cultural differences.</p>

While these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance, inform follow-up action steps, and to develop reevaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Effective public health emergency preparedness and response systems are important in mitigating the impact of all-hazards emergencies on population health. The evidence base for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is weak, however, and previous reviews have noted a substantial proportion of anecdotal event reports. To investigate the body of research excluding the anecdotal reports and better understand primary and analytical research for PHEP, a scoping review was conducted with two objectives: first, to develop a thematic map focused on primary research; and second, to use this map to inform and guide an understanding of knowledge gaps relevant to research and practice in PHEP.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results: Designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible, focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities, and were logistically feasible to implement. During execution of the exercises, nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, communications, command and control, and health care surge capacity. In contrast, performance strengths were more varied across participating sites, reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities, experience with actual public health emergencies, or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">But as an expert in health communication, I think the concept of communication is only superficially understood. There is a tendency to think of it only as determining "what" to say. However, communication is a complex process that requires not only consideration of content, but also consideration of how, to whom, at what point, and through which channel to deliver the content. Risk communication must also consider the nature of risk, people's characteristics affecting their risk perceptions, and the complex media environment. Thus, communication experts should be involved with health and medical professionals from the very beginning of the response to a public health crisis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Since 2001, state and local health departments in the United States (US) have accelerated efforts to prepare for high-impact public health emergencies. One component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities, train staff and build relationships. This paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing, conducting, and evaluating them.</p>

Participant self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves, as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging, and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design.</p>

Government has a responsibility to assist them in doing their job by providing appropriate training and equipment. • Although international collaboration can be difficult, focusing on shared values and fair procedures (procedural ethics) can bring countries together to combat the common health threat that global pandemics pose.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We attempt to describe how the performed ERC strategy, during the first days of the outbreak, might have contributed to the authorities' credibility, public trust, and outbreak control measures. We believe this case study might be useful to emergency planners for developing scenarios regarding what communication challenges to expect during the first days of a novel virus outbreak. It also represents an example of how practitioners, which are involved in the response to an outbreak, can engage in ERC evaluation efforts. Such efforts can be focused on ERC processes as in this case, or on ERC outcomes, and are both very much needed in public health emergency preparedness, as recently pointed by several literature reviews [9-11].</p>
