<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to tuberculous destroyed lung (TDL) have a poor prognosis. The aim of the present retrospective study was to develop a mortality prediction model for TDL patients who require mechanical ventilation. Methods: Data from consecutive TDL patients who had received mechanical ventilation at a single university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Korea were reviewed. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. A TDL on mechanical Ventilation (TDL-Vent) score was calculated by assigning points to variables according to β coefficient values. Results: Data from 125 patients were reviewed. A total of 36 patients (29%) died during ICU admission. On the basis of multivariate analysis, the following factors were included in the TDL-Vent score: age ≥65 years, vasopressor use, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <180. In a second regression model, a modified score was then calculated by adding brain natriuretic peptide. For TDL-Vent scores 0 to 3, the 60-day mortality rates were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (p<0.001). For modified TDL-Vent scores 0 to ≥3, the 60-day mortality rates were 0%, 21%, 33%, and 57%, respectively (p=0.001). For both the TDL-Vent score and the modified TDL-Vent score, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were larger than that of other illness severity scores.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The mechanically ventilated SARS patients were divided into two groups either with or without pneumothorax. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, ventilatory variables such as positive end-expiratory pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation and the accumulated mortality rate at 30 days after mechanical ventilation were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in the pressures and volumes between the two groups, and the mortality was also similar between the groups. However, patients developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation frequently expressed higher respiratory rates on admission, and a lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and higher PaCO 2 level during hospitalization compared with those without pneumothorax.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">A total of 396 survivors of ARDS provided data at 1 year after discharge from ICU. Fifty percent of 1-year survivors were hospitalized for 48 days or longer after discharge from ICU, with 10% spending more than six out of 12 months in stationary care. The duration of hospitalization increased significantly by the length of the initial ICU stay. All participants reported at least one outpatient visit (including visits to general practitioners), and 50% contacted four or more different medical specialties within the first year after discharge from ICU.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: For many survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the process from discharge from intensive care unit (ICU) to recovery is long and difficult. However, healthcare use after discharge from ICU has received only little attention by research. This study sets out to investigate the extent of ambulatory and stationary healthcare use among survivors of ARDS in Germany (multicenter DACAPO cohort) and to analyze predictors of stationary healthcare use.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The overall crude incidence of ARDS was 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, and increased from 2.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 personyears during the study period. The age-adjusted incidence of ARDS was 15.19 per 100,000 person-years. The overall in-hospital mortality was 57.8%. In-hospital mortality decreased from 59.7% in 1997 to 47.5% in 2011 (P < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18-29 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (>80 years, P < 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period. Patients who died during hospitalization were older (69 AE 17 versus 62 AE 19, P < 0.001) and predominantly male (69.8% versus 65.3%, P < 0.001). In addition, patients who died during hospitalization had significantly higher medical costs (6421 versus 5825 US Dollars, P < 0.001) and shorter lengths of stay (13 versus 19 days, P < 0.001) than patients who survived.</p>

Progression of RSI predicts 30-day mortality after LRI, but baseline RSI does not. Our results were derived from a cohort of patients with PIV-associated LRI, but can be applied in validated in other populations of patients with LRI.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">All data, including demographic, physiological and laboratory data, utilised in this study were collected as part of routine acute asthma care in our intensive care unit (ICU) and tertiary severe asthma centre. No additional ethical approval was required. 76 patients (46% female, mean±SD age 39±16 years) with a primary diagnosis of acute asthma associated with the clinical features of a near-fatal exacerbation requiring ECMO or mechanical ventilation were included in this analysis. 22 patients (29%) required ECMO and 54 (71%) required conventional mechanical ventilation only. Compared to patients requiring mechanical ventilation, those requiring ECMO were more likely to be female (72% versus 35%, p=0.003) and younger (mean age 30±14 versus 43±15 years, p=0.002). Prior to intervention, patients requiring ECMO had a higher total white cell count (15.5±6.4 versus 12.2±4.4×10 9 L −1 , p=0.013), were more acidotic (mean pH 7.12±0.17 versus 7.27±0.09, p<0.001) and hypercapnic (mean carbon dioxide tension 12.8±4.1 versus 7.26±2.1 kPa, p<0.001). No statistically significant differences in oxygenation (oxygen tension), C-reactive protein (CRP), total serum immunoglobulin E or blood eosinophil counts at the time of admission to the ICU were observed between groups. Patients requiring ECMO were more likely to have a positive fungal isolate from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid than those requiring mechanical ventilation (36% versus 10%, p=0.026). Rhinovirus was also identified in a greater proportion of respiratory isolates in the ECMO cohort compared to mechanical ventilation (27.2% versus 6.9%, p=0.048) with a strong trend towards a greater likelihood of any respiratory virus isolation in the ECMO group (54.5% versus 27.6%, p=0.053). There was no difference in the @ERSpublications Patients with near-fatal asthma requiring ECMO are more likely to be younger and female and are also likely to have positive viral and fungal isolates on bronchoalveolar lavage when compared to those receiving conventional mechanical ventilation http://bit.ly/2S38SaC</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05-1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07-1.17, p < 0.001). CXR scores were also independently associated with both ICU length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, CI 1.04-1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, CI 1.02-1.07, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher values on a simple visual score of a patient's CXR on admission to the medical ICU are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.</p>
