Timely and accurate diagnosis of the virus enables appropriate treatment of infections. RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: Molecular assays targeted to nucleic acid (NA) markers are becoming increasingly important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation).</p>

Aim: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. Methods: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available through European Virus Archive -Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in national and European research networks.</p>

This initiative echoed a September 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) consultation that assessed data sharing during the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak and called on researchers to make data publicly available during public health emergencies [2]. These statements were necessary because the traditional way of communicating research results-publication in peer-reviewed journals, often months or years after data collection-is too slow during an emergency.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Recent infectious outbreaks highlight the need for platform technologies that can be quickly deployed to develop therapeutics needed to contain the outbreak. We present a simple concept for rapid development of new antimicrobials. The goal was to produce in as little as one week thousands of doses of an intervention for a new pathogen. We tested the feasibility of a system based on antimicrobial synbodies. The system involves creating an array of 100 peptides that have been selected for broad capability to bind and/or kill viruses and bacteria. The peptides are pre-screened for low cell toxicity prior to large scale synthesis. Any pathogen is then assayed on the chip to find peptides that bind or kill it. Peptides are combined in pairs as synbodies and further screened for activity and toxicity. The lead synbody can be quickly produced in large scale, with completion of the entire process in one week.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Despite the persisting limitations in disaster response and management, studies related to disaster response continued to discuss the need to achieve the common goal of effective disaster management within a network with participation from regional government, central government, private organizations, citizen's groups and military units based on independence and autonomy [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, other studies outlined factors influencing disaster management and response from a macroscopic perspective and analyzed disaster management and response through awareness surveys [8, [12] [13] [14] . Discussions on disaster resilience have been increasing in recent years. The term "resilience" refers to a concept that demonstrates the attributes of the ecosystem as a system, which has become a social science concept [15] and is being applied in disaster management. After a disaster, our society requires resilience to return to normalcy following the disaster's physical and social impact. This can be regarded as part of the recovery phase of disaster management. Resilience includes not only a physical system but also disaster resilience at the organizational level, which is the ability to cooperate in coordinating key resources by going above and beyond for the community and minimizing operational confusion [16] . Despite the various disaster-related studies in Korea and abroad mentioned above, studies about disasters within the context of Korea, where discussions on disasters have only recently begun, have been qualitatively and quantitatively insufficient. Therefore, in addition to the existing studies, diverse and comprehensive discussions consisting of identification and securement of resources for disaster management; information sharing; timely and accurate communication and coordination with relevant agencies; networking processes that organically link disaster prevention and preparedness during non-disaster times; response during a disaster; recovery after a disaster; and learning from the experience of the disaster; are needed for effective disaster response. However, as the present study focused on disaster response, its discussion section did not cover recovery that includes resilience.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Translational science for new biotechnologies (e.g. drugs, vaccines, devices, or diagnostics) depend on the development of a robust 'business case'. This is driven by complex scientific, technical, logistical, financial and operational elements to determine the feasibility and probability of traversing the "valleys of death" leading to licensure. The potential results in terms of profitability and financial realization, called 'product value proposition' play a crucial role in establishing incentives for investment during and after development. With this review, our goal is to summarize the challenges in taking vaccines against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) from development through licensure and provide a perspective that these vaccines can have measurable public health and economic profitability and market success. Understanding these processes and its challenges would open the opportunity to accelerate and advance these essential NTD vaccines through the last mile towards licensure and for the delivery to afflicted populations in low-and middle-income countries.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Rapid vaccine development in response to an outbreak of a new emerging infectious disease (EID) is a goal targeted by public health agencies worldwide. This goal becomes more complicated when there are no standardized sets of viral and immunological assays, no accepted and well-characterized samples, standards or reagents, and no approved diagnostic tests for the EID pathogen. The diagnosis of infections is of critical importance to public health, but also in vaccine development in order to track incident infections during clinical trials, to differentiate natural infection responses from those that are vaccine-related and, if called for by study design, to exclude subjects with prior exposure from vaccine efficacy trials. Here we review emerging infectious disease biological standards development, vaccine clinical assay development and trial execution with the recent experiences of MERS-CoV and Zika virus as examples. There is great need to establish, in advance, the standardized reagents, sample panels, controls, and assays to support the rapid advancement of vaccine development efforts in response to EID outbreaks.</p>

Current molecular influenza virus tests were designed for use in diagnostic testing facilities, where sophisticated equipment and highly trained technicians are available. A longer turnaround time for the centralized testing than when testing near the sample source could delay the initiation of medical intervention, thereby reducing the efficacy of antiviral treatment.
