<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are characterised by an overexuberant inflammatory response and, for SARS, viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms. In our previous Correspondence to The Lancet, we described how BenevolentAI's proprietary artificial intelligence (AI)-derived knowledge graph, queried by a suite of algorithms, enabled identification of a target and a potential therapeutic against SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative organism in COVID-19). We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family—including AAK1 and GAK—the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro. Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We suggested that this drug could be of use in countering SARS-CoV-2 infections, subject to appropriate clinical testing.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2014<span class="tooltiptext">2014 Feb 4</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">A novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China in 2013, causing mild to lethal human respiratory infections. H7N9 originated with multiple reassortment events between avian viruses and carries genetic markers of human adaptation. Determining whether H7N9 induces a host response closer to that with human or avian IAV is important in order to better characterize this emerging virus. Here we compared the human lung epithelial cell response to infection with A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9) or highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2 IAV. The transcriptomic response to H7N9 was highly specific to this strain but was more similar to the response to human H3N2 than to that to other avian IAVs. H7N9 and H3N2 both elicited responses related to eicosanoid signaling and chromatin modification, whereas H7N9 specifically induced genes regulating the cell cycle and transcription. Among avian IAVs, the response to H7N9 was closest to that elicited by H5N1 virus. Host responses common to H7N9 and the other avian viruses included the lack of induction of the antigen presentation pathway and reduced proinflammatory cytokine induction compared to that with H3N2. Repression of these responses could have an important impact on the immunogenicity and virulence of H7N9 in humans. Finally, using a genome-based drug repurposing approach, we identified several drugs predicted to regulate the host response to H7N9 that may act as potential antivirals, including several kinase inhibitors, as well as FDA-approved drugs, such as troglitazone and minocycline. Importantly, we validated that minocycline inhibited H7N9 replication in vitro, suggesting that our computational approach holds promise for identifying novel antivirals.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">SARS-CoV-2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p>

We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.

Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.</p>

Despite a common coping strategy for mass casualty (earthquake and blast injury) in China, SARI epidemic has proposed a new challenge for healthcare workers, especially intensivists. About 15–20% of suspected and confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics developed severe hypoxemia (since the second week of disease course), and required some form of ventilatory support such as high-flow nasal cannula, and non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, other complications might occur, including, but not limited to, shock, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rhabdomyolysis. No antiviral agents have been proven to be effective against the coronavirus. Therefore, management of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection still remains supportive rather than definitive, indicating remarkable workload for intensive care physicians and nurses. This surge of critically ill patients in designated hospitals as well as fever clinics represents urgent demands for intensive care with regards to space, supplies, and staff (Table 1) [5,6,7,8]. Response to these demands requires cooperation between the medical rescue team, infection control specialists, local health authorities, and center for disease control and prevention [9].ER -</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.</p>

Der aus Rotalgen gewonnene Wirkstoff Carragelose bildet eine physikalische Barriere auf der Nasenschleimhaut, in der sich respiratorische Viren - darunter auch humane Coronaviren - verfangen. So wird der Kontakt zwischen ihnen und menschlichen Zellen weitestgehend unterbunden und der weitere Infektionsweg deutlich erschwert. In klinischen Studien an Patienten mit viral bedingten grippalen Infekten konnte gezeigt werden, dass Carragelose-haltige Sprays zur Anwendung in der Nase (wie algovir Effekt) die Viruslast nach drei bis vier Behandlungstagen um mehr als 90% reduzieren können. Getestet wurde die Wirksamkeit des Wirkstoffs unter anderem an verschiedenen Typen humaner Coronaviren - jedoch nicht an dem Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Daher können derzeit keine endgültigen Rückschlüsse zur Aktivität und Effektivität des Wirkstoffs gegen 2SARS-CoV-2 gezogen werden. Allerdings haben Carragelose-Erkältungssprays ein ausgezeichnetes Sicherheitsprofil, weshalb sie durchaus ergänzend zu den gängigen Maßnahmen zum Schutz vor respiratorischen Viren wie Händedesinfektion und Mundschutz angewendet und den Apothekenkunden empfohlen werden können.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In December 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the Chinese province of Hubei.[1] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition, defined coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[2] The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of February.[3] After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days, with 80% of those infected developing a mild disease, 15% a severe disease and 5% will require support in intensive care unit (ICU).[4] Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28.[4,5] SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist, thus everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal </p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-11</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the beta-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2014<span class="tooltiptext">2014 Dec 23</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The new epidemic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is caused by a type of human coronavirus called MERS-CoV which has global fatality rate of about 30%. We are investigating potential antiviral therapeutics against MERS-CoV by using host microRNAs (miRNAs) which may downregulate viral gene expression to quell viral replication. We computationally predicted potential 13 cellular miRNAs from 11 potential hairpin sequences of MERS-CoV genome. Our study provided an interesting hypothesis that those miRNAs, that is, hsa-miR-628-5p, hsa-miR-6804-3p, hsa-miR-4289, hsa-miR-208a-3p, hsa-miR-510-3p, hsa-miR-18a-3p, hsa-miR-329-3p, hsa-miR-548ax, hsa-miR-3934-5p, hsa-miR-4474-5p, hsa-miR-7974, hsa-miR-6865-5p, and hsa-miR-342-3p, would be antiviral therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.</p>

The situation has prompted some start-ups to rethink their contingency plans—particularly when it comes to chemistry services. Biotech firms had anticipated delays related to the Lunar New Year holidays, and so far outbreak-related travel restrictions have extended that work gap by only a week. But as the virus spreads—according to Chinese authorities, as of Feb. 13, more than 60,100 people had been infected and nearly 1,400 had died, most of them in China—some biotech firms that rely on China are becoming nervous about how long their projects could be on hold. Much attention is on WuXi AppTec, the largest Chinese CRO.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-27</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-10</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background: The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. Results: The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Conclusions: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

Based on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV, we used the hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus. Weight loss and virus replication in lung were observed in hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of significant lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium, and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities. Viral antigens were observed in the bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia. The phenomenon was not found in wild type mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice was clarified and the Kochs postulates were fulfilled as well, and the mouse model may facilitate the development of therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Lack of critical care resource in face of COVID-19 epidemics Based on data reported by the National Health Commission of China, there have been about 2000 new confirmed cases and?>?4000 suspected cases daily over the past week in Wuhan [3]. About 15% of the patients have developed severe pneumonia, and about 6% need noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support. Currently, there are about 1000 patients who need ventilatory support and another 120 new patients daily who require noninvasive or invasive ventilation support in Wuhan city; however, there are only about 600 ICU beds [4]. To address this shortfall, 70 ICU beds were created from general beds and the government quickly transformed three general hospitals to critical care hospitals with a total of about 2500 beds that specialize in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (equipped with monitors and high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator or invasive ventilators). An equally great (or potentially greater) problem is the shortage of trained personnel to treat these critically ill patients. Until the crisis, there were about 300 ICU physicians and 1000 ICU nurses in Wuhan city. By the end of January, more than 600 additional ICU doctors and 1500 ICU nurses were transferred to Wuhan from the rest of China. As well, an additional 3000 staff including infectious disease, respiratory, internal medicine physicians and nurses were transferred to Wuhan by the government. There are logistical issues which make care of the patients difficult. These include donning of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, respiratory and eye protection), lack of instruments and disposables, and shortages of supplemental oxygen. Many severe hypoxemic patients only receive high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rather than invasive mechanical ventilation because of intubation delay or lack of mechanical ventilators (especially at early phase). Our preliminary data show that only about 25% of patients who died were intubated and received mechanical ventilation.JO - Intensive Care Medicine</p>

Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed.  Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Lymphopenia can be used to indicate clinical course, treatment effect and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The world is faced with a remarkable coronavirus outbreak with epicentre in Wuhan, China. Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Seafood tanks, air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from various sources. The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited.</p>

We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir. The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">ABSTRACT Emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019, has caused a large global outbreak and a major public health issue. As of February 11, 2020, data from the WHO has shown that more than 43,000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with more than 99% of the cases being detected in China. On January 30, 2020, WHO has declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among the patients with pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground glass opacity was the most common finding from computerized tomography images of the chest. Although the one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the United States responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.</p>

This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive.  This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Corona Virus Disease- 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Two other corona virus infections-- SARS in 2002–2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-- both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All three of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by beta-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020 and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.</p>

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes.  100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method.  In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients.  CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-11</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Central China and rapidly spread throughout China. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests) in the previous three months. The results showed that eighty haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of SARS-CoV-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pangolin may not be an intermediate host. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximately 2 km), which indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately conclude that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term, which would have led to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other areas. The EBSP results showed that the first estimated expansion date began from 7 December 2019, which indicated that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could have begun from person to person in mid to late November.</p>

Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 had been transmitted rapidly in more than 29 countries to date (https://www.who.int), including Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, and Oceania, posing serious concerns about its pandemic potential. Despite of droplet and contact transmissions of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted via aerosol and fecal–oral routes 3 (Figure 1), which needs to be paid attention in particular.</p>

Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p&lt;0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3).   Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.</jats:p></p>

There, doctors and scientists are desperately struggling to find reliable ways to diagnose infected patients to help treat them and control the spread of the virus. The struggle has involved two diagnostic options—computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs and a nucleic acid lab test—each with advantages and disadvantages.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-20</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2. Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Let’s take inventory on the therapies that are being developed for the coronavirus epidemic. Here is a very thorough list of at Biocentury, and I should note that (like Stat and several other organizations) they’re making all their Covid-19 content free to all readers during this crisis. I’d like to zoom in today on the potential small-molecule therapies, since some of these have the most immediate prospects for use in the real world. The ones at the front of the line are repurposed drugs that are already approved for human use, for a lot of obvious reasons. The Biocentury list doesn’t cover these, but here’s an article at Nature Biotechnology that goes into detail. Clinical trials are a huge time sink – they sort of have to be, in most cases, if they’re going to be any good – and if you’ve already done all that stuff it’s a huge leg up, even if the drug itself is not exactly a perfect fit for the disease. So what do we have? The compound that is most advanced is probably remdesivir from Gilead, at right. This has been in development for a few years as an RNA virus therapy – it was originally developed for Ebola, and has been tried out against a whole list of single-strand RNA viruses. That includes the related coronaviruses SARS and MERS, so Covid-19 was an obvious fit. The compound is a prodrug – that phosphoramide gets cleaved off completely, leaving the active 5-OH compound GS-44-1524. It mechanism of action is to get incorporated into viral RNA, since it’s taken up by RNA polymerase and it largely seems to evade proofreading. This causes RNA termination trouble later on, since that alpha-nitrile C-nucleoside is not exactly what the virus is expecting in its genome at that point, and thus viral replication is inhibited.</p>

To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.</jats:p></p>

In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-27</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2.  Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.</jats:p></p>

The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-20</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-03</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Abstract Objectives To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis.  Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (&gt;10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset.  Conclusions  The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-16</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">At the end of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 induces an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in China1, even more spread than SARS-CoV infection2. The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-08</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: A novel coronavirus named as "SARS-CoV-2" has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: &lt;= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: &gt;= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: &lt;= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: &gt;= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR).  Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P &gt; 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P &gt; 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.</jats:p></p>

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.  Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR.  Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced. Funding None.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-02</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.</p>

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-20</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Using incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with low SARS-CoV titer. In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.  ImportanceGiven the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Tetracyclines were developed as a result of the screening of soil samples for antibiotics. The first(t) of these compounds, chlortetracycline, was introduced in 1947. Tetracyclines were found to be highly effective against various pathogens including rickettsiae, as well as both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, thus becoming the first class of broad spectrum antibiotics. Many other interesting properties, unrelated to their antibiotic activity, have been identified for tetracyclines which have led to widely divergent experimental and clinical uses. For example, tetracyclines are also an effective anti-malarial drug. Minocycline, which can readily cross cell membranes, is known to be a potent anti-apoptotic agent. Another tetracycline, doxycycline is known to exert anti-protease activities. Doxycycline can inhibit matrix metalloproteinases which contribute to tissue destruction activities in diseases such as periodontitis. A large body of literature has provided additional evidence for the “beneficial” actions of tetracyclines, including their ability to act as reactive oxygen species scavengers and anti-inflammatory agents. This review provides a summary of tetracycline’s multiple mechanisms of action as a means to understand their beneficial effects.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Antiviral drugs for managing infections with human coronaviruses are not yet approved, posing a serious challenge to current global efforts aimed at containing the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogues. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i+3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.</p>

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia.  RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients.  Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P&gt;0.05).  Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P&lt;0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia.  severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery.  CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-08</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies.  Methods:  We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S.  Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the  situation becomes clearer.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-26</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-07</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus. Currently, no effective antiviral agents exist against this type of virus. A cell-based assay, with SARS virus and Vero E6 cells, was developed to screen existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds to identify effective anti-SARS agents. Of >10,000 agents tested, ≈50 compounds were found active at 10 μM; among these compounds, two are existing drugs (Reserpine 13 and Aescin 5) and several are in clinical development. These 50 active compounds were tested again, and compounds 2–6, 10, and 13 showed active at 3 μM. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for the inhibition of viral replication (EC(50)) and host growth (CC(50)) were then measured and the selectivity index (SI = CC(50)/EC(50)) was determined. The EC(50), based on ELISA, and SI for Reserpine, Aescim, and Valinomycin are 3.4 μM (SI = 7.3), 6.0 μM (SI = 2.5), and 0.85 μM (SI = 80), respectively. Additional studies were carried out to further understand the mode of action of some active compounds, including ELISA, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assays, and inhibition against the 3CL protease and viral entry. Of particular interest are the two anti-HIV agents, one as an entry blocker and the other as a 3CL protease inhibitor (K(i) = 0.6 μM).</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-09</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both group 2B coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.</p>

Over a month since the outbreak, more than 13,000 patients with COVID-19 have be cured and discharged from hospital until now. For the clinical cure criteria in China, twice successive negative results of Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection are the important index, in addition to normal body temperature for 3 days as well as obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and CT scan [2]. In the present work, we reported that Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid was still detectable in sputum obtained by nebulization from a cured patient. On January 22, a 49-year-old man presented himself with fever for 4 days to a clinic. Throat swab detection was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria [2] as follows (1): the positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (2); a history of short stay in Wuhan within 14 days; and (3) symptoms of fever, and multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity on CT scan. After the active treatment, the patient recovered from fever and other respiratory symptoms on February 4. On February 9 and February 10, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was successively negative in his throat swab samples. The CT scan result showed that the inflammation was significantly decreased in both lungs. Both the results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection and CT scans indicated a recovery trend, and the patient was ready for discharge.

Limited clinical experience in managing pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates has been reported from China recently based on a case series of nine pregnancies with confirmed COVID-19 treated in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and 10 neonates (nine pregnancies) delivered at five different hospitals,11, 12 although many more cases (>100) of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have been treated and delivered in several hospitals in China according to the news releases and media reports. So far, no maternal deaths have been reported. There appears to be some risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, fetal tachycardia and fetal distress when the infection occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, there is no evidence suggesting transplacental transmission based on very limited data, as the analysis of amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breast milk samples available from six of the nine patients were found to be negative for SARS-COV-2.

The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses can help identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in coronavirus viral sequences. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.</p>

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples.  Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.</jats:p></p>
