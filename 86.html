<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-17</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>The total number of COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this infection in Wuhan, China has reached 40000 and are still growing. To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-25</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Purpose: The 2019 novel coronavirus(COVID-19) mainly transmitted by person-to-person through inhalation of respiratory droplets. We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China. Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study. Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods:  All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We  collected  conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens. Results: One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases  were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests. Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19. And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 149 RT-PCR confirmed positive patients were consecutively enrolled from January 17th to February 10th, 2020 in three tertiary hospitals of Wenzhou. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 15th, 2020. Findings A total of 85 patients had Hubei travel/residence history, while another 49 had contact with people from Hubei and 15 had no traceable exposure history to Hubei. Fever, cough and expectoration were the most common symptoms, 14 patients had decreased oxygen saturation, 33 had leukopenia, 53 had lymphopenia, and 82 had elevated C reactive protein. On chest computed tomography, lung segments 6 and 10 were mostly involved. A total of 287 segments presented ground glass opacity, 637 presented mixed opacity and 170 presented consolidation. Lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung with a patchy form. No significant difference was found between patients with or without Hubei exposure history. Seventeen patients had normal CT on admission of these, 12 had negative findings even10 days later. Interpretation Most patients presented with a mild infection in our study. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed opacity with predominance in the lower lung is highly suspicious of COVID-19 in the first week of disease onset. Nevetheless, some patients can present with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19. Funding: We did not receive any fundings.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Rohit Shankar left the virology laboratory at 2 a.m. on Wednesday, and was back at the lab bench by 7 a.m. the same day. “It’s okay,” he says, “I had a doughnut and a coffee.” Shankar, a medical scientist, and his colleagues at the University of Washington in Seattle are poised to exponentially drive up the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 around the city, in western Washington state. That’s because this week, they began analysing a mountain of nose and throat swabs collected from hospitals in the region. Already, the researchers are seeing clear signs that the virus has infected vastly more people than have been formally detected. Scientists fear coronavirus spread in countries least able to contain it Washington state has become the United States’ ground zero for COVID-19, which has now spread to more than 90 countries worldwide in what seems to be a new and dangerous phase of the outbreak. Washington has declared a state emergency, and ten people there have died from the disease. But the number of confirmed cases in Washington — 70 — is still an underestimate resulting from a lack of testing, researchers agree. A genomic analysis posted online on 29 February suggested that hundreds of people in western Washington might already be infected. Academic scientists have mostly been prevented from measuring the extent of the US outbreak because of federal rules restricting the number of labs qualified to run diagnostic tests. But that is changing now, and helps account for why the state's caseload jumped from 10 to 70 this week. Dozens of virologists and genomicists have now kicked into high gear in Seattle, dropping or adapting projects to devote resources to the outbreak. Researchers are working around the clock to find out how many people have the disease in the area. Others are analysing genomes to reveal how the virus is transmitted or developing new therapies. The scientists are racing to help Washington avoid the fate of Hubei province in China, where more than 2,900 people have died of COVID-19 so far. The coronavirus emerged in the province’s city Wuhan in December, and the initial response from officials was slow. “We are past the point of containment,” says Helen Chu, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Washington School of Medicine (UW Medicine) in Seattle. “So now we need to keep the people who are vulnerable from getting sick.”</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-23</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.  Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed.    Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.  Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>The ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has engendered numerous cases of infection and death. COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h. Parallel testing with approved qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.</jats:p></p>

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L; age &lt; 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age &lt; 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L, 0%) (P &lt;0.001), respectively.  Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">WHO recommends against wearing masks in community settings because of lack of evidence.2 However, absence of evidence of effectiveness should not be equated to evidence of ineffectiveness, especially when facing a novel situation with limited alternative options. It has long been recommended that for respiratory infections like influenza, affected patients should wear masks to limit droplet spread. If everyone puts on a mask in public places, it would help to remove stigmatisation that has hitherto discouraged masking of symptomatic patients in many places.3 Furthermore, transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals has been documented for COVID-19, and viral load is particularly high at early disease stage.4 , 5 Masking, as a public health intervention, would probably intercept the transmission link and prevent these apparently healthy infectious sources.</p>

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.</jats:p></p>

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was &lt; 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2011<span class="tooltiptext">2011 Jun 16</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">BACKGROUND: We developed an extendable open-source Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification (LAMP) signature design program called LAVA (LAMP Assay Versatile Analysis). LAVA was created in response to limitations of existing LAMP signature programs. RESULTS: LAVA identifies combinations of six primer regions for basic LAMP signatures, or combinations of eight primer regions for LAMP signatures with loop primers, which can be used as LAMP signatures. The identified primers are conserved among target organism sequences. Primer combinations are optimized based on lengths, melting temperatures, and spacing among primer sites. We compare LAMP signature candidates for Staphylococcus aureus created both by LAVA and by PrimerExplorer. We also include signatures from a sample run targeting all strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and demonstrated new software for identifying signature candidates appropriate for LAMP assays.

We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir. The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage.

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-10</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>BACKGROUND Nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed.  Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes.  100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method.  In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients.  CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">On 31st December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay which is used in >30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 TCID50/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRd-P2-negative specimens [119/273 (43.6%) vs 77/273 (28.2%), P<0.001], including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21*104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21*102 to 4.71*105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">In genetic diagnostics, the emergence of a so-called "patent thicket" is imminent. Such an overlapping set of patent rights may have restrictive effects on further research and development of diagnostic tests, and the provision of clinical diagnostic services. Currently, two models that may facilitate access to and use of patented genetic inventions are attracting much debate in various national and international fora: patent pools and clearing houses. In this article, we explore the concept of clearing houses. Several types of clearing houses are identified. First, we describe and discuss two types that would provide access to information on the patented inventions: the information clearing house and the technology exchange clearing house. Second, three types of clearing houses are analysed that not only offer access to information but also provide an instrument to facilitate the use of the patented inventions: the open access clearing house, the standardized licences clearing house and the royalty collection clearing house. A royalty collection clearing house for genetic diagnostic testing would be the most comprehensive as it would serve several functions: identifying patents and patent claims essential to diagnostic testing, matching licensees with licensors, developing and supplying standardized licences, collecting royalties, monitoring whether users respect licensing conditions, and providing dispute resolution services such as mediation and arbitration. In this way, it might function as an effective model for users to facilitate access to and use of the patented inventions. However, it remains to be seen whether patent holders with a strong patent portfolio will be convinced by the advantages of the royalty collection clearing house and be willing to participate.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background There’s an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020. Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics. Conclusions Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Viral clearance is one important indicator for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection. We propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the COVID-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Speed is critical in the response to COVID-19. So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely? The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases—and test them faster—have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests. In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.</p>

Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection. Moreover, our provided protocol can be extended for testing the other 66 provided designs. Assay designs are available at https://adapt.sabetilab.org/.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases.  Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p&lt;0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Abstract Background: The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hubei and other areas are different. We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020.  Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p&lt;0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15).  Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group. Laboratory and imaging examination can assist in the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p></p>

We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P&lt;0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19×10^9/L (±1.47) versus 7.21×10^9/L (±2.94), P&lt;0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39×10^9/L (±1.48) versus 5.38×10^9/L (±2.85), P&lt;0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008).  Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.</jats:p></p>

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19.  Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%，68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions.  In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic.  We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present.  For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak.  In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.      We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not.  We believe that is a policy question.  If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place.  Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.</jats:p></p>

In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak.  Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak.  Conclusion: Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.</jats:p></p>

METHODS: We conducted a survey of 49 clinical laboratories in medical institutions and referral medical laboratories. A short questionnaire to survey clinical laboratory practices relating to MERS-CoV diagnostic testing was sent by email to the directors and clinical pathologists in charge of the clinical laboratories performing MERS-CoV testing. The survey focused on testing volume, reporting of results, resources, and laboratory safety. RESULTS: A total of 40 clinical laboratories responded to the survey. A total of 27,009 MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) tests were performed. Most of the specimens were sputum (73.5%). The median turnaround time (TAT) was 5.29 hr (first and third quartile, 4.11 and 7.48 hr) in 26 medical institutions. The median TAT of more than a half of the laboratories (57.7%) was less than 6 hr. Many laboratories were able to perform tests throughout the whole week. Laboratory biosafety preparedness included class II biosafety cabinets (100%); separated pre-PCR, PCR, and post-PCR rooms (88.6%); negative pressure pretreatment rooms (48.6%); and negative pressure sputum collection rooms (20.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical laboratories were able to quickly expand their diagnostic capacity in response to the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak. Our results show that clinical laboratories play an important role in the maintenance and enhancement of laboratory response in preparation for future emerging infections.</p>

This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We performed a cost analysis study using decision tree modeling to determine whether the use of multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses (xTAG RVP test) is a more or less costly strategy than the status quo testing methods used for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections in pediatric patients. The decision tree model was constructed by using four testing strategies for respiratory virus detection, viz., direct fluorescent-antibody staining (DFA) alone, DFA plus shell vial culture (SVC), the xTAG RVP test alone, or DFA plus the xTAG RVP test. A review of the charts of 661 pediatric patients was used to determine the length of hospital stay, the number of days in isolation, antibiotic usage, and all other medical procedures performed. The cost of hospitalization by diagnostic status was determined on the basis of the average cost per patient and the number of patients in each arm of the decision tree. The cost per case was the highest for DFA plus SVC at $3,914 (in Canadian dollars), and the lowest was for the xTAG RVP test alone at $3,623, while the costs of DFA alone ($3,911) and DFA plus RVP ($3,849) were intermediate. When all four diagnostic strategies were compared, the least costly strategy was the xTAG RVP test alone when the prevalence of infection was 11% or higher and DFA alone when the prevalence was under 11%. These data indicate a savings of $291 per case investigated if the strategy of using the xTAG RVP test alone was used to replace the status quo test of DFA plus SVC, resulting in a savings of $529,620 per year in direct costs for the four Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, hospitals on the basis of the testing of specimens from 1,820 pediatric inpatients. We conclude that the use of the xTAG RVP test is the least costly strategy for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections in children and would generate a significant savings for hospitals.</p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Real-time PCR has revolutionized the way clinical microbiology laboratories diagnose many human microbial infections. This testing method combines PCR chemistry with fluorescent probe detection of amplified product in the same reaction vessel. In general, both PCR and amplified product detection are completed in an hour or less, which is considerably faster than conventional PCR detection methods. Real-time PCR assays provide sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of conventional PCR combined with Southern blot analysis, and since amplification and detection steps are performed in the same closed vessel, the risk of releasing amplified nucleic acids into the environment is negligible. The combination of excellent sensitivity and specificity, low contamination risk, and speed has made real-time PCR technology an appealing alternative to culture- or immunoassay-based testing methods for diagnosing many infectious diseases. This review focuses on the application of real-time PCR in the clinical microbiology laboratory.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-27</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.  Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected.  Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (&gt;77%) and considered effective (&gt;90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).  Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.</jats:p></p>

The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool.

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The proposed assay detected the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian Central-West.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Abstract The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.</jats:p></p>

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8（IQR, 0.6-1.1）109/L in Wuhan, 1.0（IQR, 0.7-1.4）109/L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-23</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.  Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level.  Results   The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January.  Conclusion   Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">As of 15 February 2020, Singapore had screened a total of 991 suspect cases for COVID-19, of which 72 cases tested positive, 812 cases tested negative, while the remaining 107 had pending results.(1) Besides optimising sample type to increase yield, (2) the challenge in clinical management of suspect cases lies in deciding whether they may be de-isolated or if further isolation and repeat testing is required. No single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspect case. In our series of positive cases, samples from one suspect case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts,(3) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may not return positive initially. (4) Our suspect case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection. Dual infections can occur in 10- 20% of viral acute respiratory infections, as has been reported with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. (5) In our case series, one patient with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal aspirate also exhibited clinical symptoms compatible with dengue fever. This was laboratory confirmed by dengue NS1 antigen test. (PL Lim, personal communication).</p>

DESIGN, SETTING: A before‐and‐after study in four metropolitan EDs in New South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 1491 consecutive patients tested by standard multiplex PCR during July–December 2016, and 2250 tested by rapid PCR during July–December 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admissions; ED length of stay (LOS); test turnaround time; patient receiving test result before leaving the ED; ordering of other laboratory tests. RESULTS: Compared with those tested by standard PCR, fewer patients tested by rapid PCR were admitted to hospital (73.3% v 77.7%; P < 0.001) and more received their test results before leaving the ED (67.4% v 1.3%; P < 0.001); the median test turnaround time was also shorter (2.4 h [IQR, 1.6–3.9 h] v 26.7 h [IQR, 21.2–37.8 h]). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital was also lower in the rapid PCR group for both children under 18 (50.6% v 66.6%; P < 0.001) and patients over 60 years of age (84.3% v 91.8%; P < 0.001).

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection.   Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.   Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2008<span class="tooltiptext">2008 Sep 25</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">BACKGROUND: In recent years real-time PCR has become a leading technique for nucleic acid detection and quantification. These assays have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in the clinical laboratory. Choice of primer and probe sequences is critical for accurate diagnosis in the clinic, yet current primer/probe signature design strategies are limited, and signature evaluation methods are lacking. METHODS: We assessed the quality of a signature by predicting the number of true positive, false positive and false negative hits against all available public sequence data. We found real-time PCR signatures described in recent literature and used a BLAST search based approach to collect all hits to the primer-probe combinations that should be amplified by real-time PCR chemistry. We then compared our hits with the sequences in the NCBI taxonomy tree that the signature was designed to detect. RESULTS: We found that many published signatures have high specificity (almost no false positives) but low sensitivity (high false negative rate). Where high sensitivity is needed, we offer a revised methodology for signature design which may designate that multiple signatures are required to detect all sequenced strains. We use this methodology to produce new signatures that are predicted to have higher sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: We show that current methods for real-time PCR assay design have unacceptably low sensitivities for most clinical applications. Additionally, as new sequence data becomes available, old assays must be reassessed and redesigned. A standard protocol for both generating and assessing the quality of these assays is therefore of great value. Real-time PCR has the capacity to greatly improve clinical diagnostics. The improved assay design and evaluation methods presented herein will expedite adoption of this technique in the clinical lab.</p>

However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures:  High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; α-HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-10</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012. Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The seeming precision of the global tallies of cases and deaths caused by the novel coronavirus now spreading from Wuhan, China belies an alarming fact. The world is in the dark about the epidemic’s real scale and speed, because existing tests have limited powers—and testing is far too spotty. “We are underestimating how common this infection is,” cautions Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust. Within days of Chinese researchers releasing the sequence of the virus on 11 January, scientists developed tests capable of detecting genetic sequences that distinguish the new agent from other coronaviruses circulating in humans. By 28 January, China’s National Medical Products Administration had approved diagnostic test kits from five companies. It was an astonishing pace for the response to a pathogen never seen before—and yet it was only a beginning.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-08</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>BACKGROUND Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide. Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P &lt; 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P &lt; 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P &lt; 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P &lt; 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.</jats:p></p>

Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).  We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS.  We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene.  Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.</jats:p></p>

Methods：In this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020 were recruited. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020.  Results：267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-17</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.</jats:p></p>

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively compared use of antibiotics, chest radiographs, and isolation precautions for patients <18 years old (excluding neonates) hospitalized at a tertiary referral center tested for respiratory pathogens in the emergency department or during the first 2 hospital days, during two periods: June 2010–June 2012 (non-MPCR group) vs. October 2012-May 2014 (MPCR group). RESULTS: Subjects (n=2430) in the MPCR group were older, had more complex chronic conditions, and were admitted to the PICU more often compared with the non-MPCR (n=2349) group. Subjects in the MPCR group had more positive tests (42.4% vs. 14.4%, p<0.01), received fewer days of antibiotics (4 vs. 5 median antibiotic days, p<0.01), fewer chest radiographs performed, (59% vs. 78%, p<0.01), and were placed in isolation longer (20 vs. 0 median isolation-hours, p<0.01) compared with the non-MPCR group. In multivariable regression, patients tested with MPCR were less likely to receive antibiotics for ≥2 days (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.5-0.6), chest radiographs at admission (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.4), and more likely to be in isolation for ≥2 days (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.1-2.8 compared with the non- MPCR group. CONCLUSIONS: Use of MPCR testing for respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients was significantly associated with decreased healthcare resource utilization, including decreased use of antibiotics and chest radiographs, and increased use of isolation precautions.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2016<span class="tooltiptext">2016 May 23</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">BACKGROUND: The largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outside Middle East Asia in 2015 has necessitated the rapid expansion of laboratories that conduct MERS-CoV molecular testing in Korea, together with external quality assessment (EQA) to evaluate the assays used. METHODS: The EQA program consisted of two phases; self-validation and blind assessment. For the first EQA phase, in vitro transcribed upstream region of the envelope gene (upE) and the open reading frame (ORF)1a RNAs were used at a concentration of 1,000 copies/µL. The test panel for the second EQA phase consisted of RNA extracts from three samples, which were obtained from two MERS-CoV positive patients and one MERS-CoV negative patient. RESULTS: The first EQA phase results for 46 participants showed a linear relationship between the threshold cycle (C(T)) values of RNA materials and the logarithmic concentrations for both upE and ORF1a gene targets (R(2)=0.73 and 0.75, respectively). The mean C(T) value for each concentration was different depending on which commercial kit was used for the assay. Among the three commonly used kits, PowerChek MERS Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Korea) showed the lowest C(T) values at all concentrations of upE and most concentrations of ORF1a. The second EQA phase results for 47 participants were 100% correct for all tested samples. CONCLUSIONS: This EQA survey demonstrates that the MERS-CoV molecular testing performed in Korea during the 2015 outbreak is of robust capability. However, careful establishment and validation of a cut-off value are recommended to ensure good analytical sensitivity.</p>

Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.  Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.  One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.</p>

Performance characteristics evaluated included positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the FilmArray RP. Discordant analysis was performed using bidirectional sequencing. A time and motion study was performed to compare the laboratory workflow of the two tests. Three hundred samples were included in the study. There were no samples positive for B. parapertussis. The PPA and NPA of the Aries BA were 61.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.8 to 82.7%) and 100% (95% CI, 98.7 to 100%). Discordant results included five Bordetella bronchiseptica results that were incorrectly identified as B. pertussis by the FilmArray RP and one false-negative result for both the Aries BA and the FilmArray RP. The overall agreement between the Aries BA and FilmArray RP for the detection of B. pertussis was considered good at 97.7% with a kappa value of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.9). The Aries BA offers a new diagnostic option for the rapid and targeted approach to the diagnosis of pertussis. Unlike the FilmArray RP, the Aries BA did not cross-react with B. bronchiseptica in our study, although a larger sample set should be tested to confirm this finding.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-23</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Abstract Background：Since December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2（SARS-CoV-2）-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019，COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , China，and rapidly spread throughout China，even throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan area，and explore its effective treatment.  Methods：Retrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020；The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results： Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43（84.3%）patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan，and 4（7.7%） patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4（7.7%） patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])，Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])，all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])，most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P &lt;0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). Conclusion：In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia，Some patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &amp;ldquo:generations” was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. Just 9 of 16 severe patients required ICU care. Until Feb 12, 2020, 40 (38.46%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. For the antiviral treatment, 80 (76.92%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine therapy. Conclusions: Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19. The incubation period of 8 patients exceeded 14 days.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2011<span class="tooltiptext">2011 Feb 7</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">BACKGROUND: Direct immunofluorescence assays (DFA) are a rapid and inexpensive method for the detection of respiratory viruses and may therefore be used for surveillance. Few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on DFA and none included respiratory picornaviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We wished to evaluate the use of DFA for epidemiological studies with a long-term observation of respiratory viruses that includes both respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV. METHODS: Since 1998 all children hospitalized with respiratory illness at the University Hospital Bern have been screened with DFA for common respiratory viruses including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, and parainfluenza virus 1-3. In 2006 assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV were added. Here we describe the epidemiological pattern for these respiratory viruses detected by DFA in 10'629 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 8'285 patients during a 12-year period (1998-2010). RESULTS: Addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV raised the proportion of positive DFA results from 35% to 58% (p < 0.0001). Respiratory picornaviruses were the most common viruses detected among patients ≥1 year old. The seasonal patterns and age distribution for the studied viruses agreed well with those reported in the literature. In 2010, an hMPV epidemic of unexpected size was observed. CONCLUSIONS: DFA is a valid, rapid, flexible and inexpensive method. The addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV broadens its range of viral detection. DFA is, even in the "PCR era", a particularly adapted method for the long term surveillance of respiratory viruses in a pediatric population.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-13</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background:  2019-Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods:  We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings:  Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.</jats:p></p>

This study explored the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Jingmen. Methods: All confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the First People′s Hospital of Jingmen are included from January 12 to February 14,2020. Cases were analyzed for epidemiological data and were confirmed by real-time PCR.  Findings: Of the 213 cases (108 men and 105 women) , 88 (41%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years ( range,2-88 years;IQR,35-58.5). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years(range,33-82 years,IQR, 57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7 %(22)  were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the controlled measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared after 20 days. Interpretation: All people are susceptible to the COVID-19, but older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to have severe symptoms. Even though COVID-19 is highly contagious, control measures have proven to be very effective.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-29</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-10</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Objectives The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results  While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-13</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country.  Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% &amp; 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Background Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia. Purpose To determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals. The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined. Results Twenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17±4 days (range: 11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p<0.001). Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2±2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (≥14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-19</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background A new type of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings.  Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-25</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender.  Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-29</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear. Methods  Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis. Results The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P &lt; 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P &lt; 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012). Conclusions Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">BACKGROUND: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-23</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures. Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings  Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P&lt;0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation  The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.</jats:p></p>

We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p&lt;0.001).  INTERPRETATION This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.</jats:p></p>

The patient was one of two people who together formed a missing link between two clusters of cases that each occurred in a Singaporean church. Researchers around the world are racing to develop antibody tests, also called serological tests, that can confirm whether someone was infected even after their immune system has cleared the virus that causes COVID-19. The group that developed the test, at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, is among the front-runners, although its assay has to be validated before it is taken into production and deployed widely.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-03-06</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.</jats:p></p>

Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.</jats:p></p>

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.</jats:p></p>

In a phase II clinical trial, 21 patients with pretreated metastatic NPC underwent NST with sibling PBSC allografts, using CY conditioning, thymic irradiation and in vivo T-cell depletion with thymoglobulin. Stable lymphohematopoietic chimerism was achieved in most patients and prophylactic CYA was tapered at a median of day +30. Seven patients (33%) showed partial response and three (14%) achieved stable disease. Four patients were alive at 2 years and three showed prolonged disease control of 344, 525 and 550 days. With a median follow-up of 209 (4–1147) days, the median PFS was 100 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 66–128 days), and median OS was 209 days (95% CI, 128–236 days). Patients with chronic GVHD had better survival—median OS 426 days (95% CI, 194–NE days) vs 143 days (95% CI, 114–226 days) (P=0.010). Thus, NST may induce meaningful clinical responses in patients with advanced NPC.</p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Summary Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020-02-20</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><jats:p>Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic.  Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively.  Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">2020<span class="tooltiptext">2020</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today recommended a dramatic shift in how it implements regulations that control whether laboratories can use diagnostic kits created in-house to test for infections of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). “We issued a policy this morning that allows us to have a lot of flexibility around the development of diagnostic tests,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn at a White House briefing with President Donald Trump this afternoon. “We expect this policy to have a significant impact.” The change could greatly expand the number of laboratories able to do coronavirus testing. The U.S. government has come under severe criticism for not providing nearly enough tests needed to understand the extent of spread in the population. A test kit produced and distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was shelved after state and local lab trying it out discovered that it contained a faulty reagent. As a result, many labs that have the capability to test themselves have not been allowed to do so. The new recommendations focus on “high-complexity testing laboratories” that are certified under federal rules known as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. This group of facilities includes many hospital labs, like the one that epidemiologist Michael Mina works at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Essentially it’s opening up a clear and concise avenue for labs like the one at Brigham and Women’s,” says Mina. “It’s what I’ve been advocating for a month now.”</p>

Current assays and platforms, however, often require lengthy experimental procedures and multiple instruments to remove contaminants and inhibitors from clinically-relevant, complex samples. This requirement of sample preparation has been a bottleneck for using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) at the point of care (POC), though advances in “lab-on-chip” platforms that integrate sample preparation and NAATs have made great strides in this space. Alternatively, direct NAATs—techniques that minimize or even bypass sample preparation—present promising strategies for developing POC diagnostic tools for analyzing real-world samples. In this review, we discuss the current status of direct NAATs. Specifically, we surveyed potential testing systems published from 1989 to 2017, and analyzed their performances in terms of robustness, sensitivity, clinical relevance, and suitability for POC diagnostics. We introduce bubble plots to facilitate our analysis, as bubble plots enable effective visualization of the performances of these direct NAATs. Through our review, we hope to initiate an in-depth examination of direct NAATs and their potential for realizing POC diagnostics, and ultimately transformative technologies that can further enhance healthcare.</p>

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia.  RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients.  Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P&gt;0.05).  Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P&lt;0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia.  severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery.  CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.</jats:p></p>

<i class="tooltip">(no date)<span class="tooltiptext">(no date)</span></i><p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express a hepatitis B virus–specific (HBV-specific) T cell receptor (TCR) may supplement HBV-specific immune responses in chronic HBV patients and facilitate HBV control. However, the risk of triggering unrestrained proliferation of permanently engineered T cells raises safety concerns that have hampered testing of this approach in patients. The aim of the present study was to generate T cells that transiently express HBV-specific TCRs using mRNA electroporation and to assess their antiviral and pathogenetic activity in vitro and in HBV-infected human liver chimeric mice. We assessed virological and gene-expression changes using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Luminex technology. HBV-specific T cells lysed HBV-producing hepatoma cells in vitro. In vivo, 3 injections of HBV-specific T cells caused progressive viremia reduction within 12 days of treatment in animals reconstituted with haplotype-matched hepatocytes, whereas viremia remained stable in mice receiving irrelevant T cells redirected toward hepatitis C virus–specific TCRs. Notably, increases in alanine aminotransferase levels, apoptotic markers, and human inflammatory cytokines returned to pretreatment levels within 9 days after the last injection. T cell transfer did not trigger inflammation in uninfected mice. These data support the feasibility of using mRNA electroporation to engineer HBV TCR–redirected T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection.</p>
